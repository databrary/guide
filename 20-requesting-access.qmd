## Should I register for Authorized Investigator or Affiliate Status? {-} 

I am an **Authorized Investigator** if:  

  + I can conduct independent research;  
  + I can submit funding proposals as the lead investigator;  
  + I have Principal Investigator Status or a tenure-track faculty position at my Institution;  
  + My Institution maintains or uses an ethics board to review and approve research involving human subjects (or animals where relevant); AND
  + I have current training that addresses research ethics with human subject (or animals where relevant)    

I am an **Affiliate** if: 

  + I conduct research under the supervision of a Principal Investigator an Authorized Investigator's sponsorship; AND
  + I am a student, research staff, or post-doctoral researcher  


Your Supervisor or Research Sponsor must register as an Authorized Investigator BEFORE you may request affiliate access from them.
