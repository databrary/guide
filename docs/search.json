Groups of data files related to a specific person or people (or non-human animal), a date, time, and location are grouped into sessions (slots) within a volume. Individual files (assets) of varying types are organized within a session (slot). Sessions (slots) and files (assets) are assigned system-wide unique (integer) identifiers.\nIndividual users and institutions (called parties) are assigned system-wide unique identifiers and have some overlapping data elements (e.g., prename, sortname). Access privileges are granted hierarchically in a parent/child organization. For example, Databrary is the parent of New York University (NYU); NYU is the parent of Karen Adolph and multiple other Authorized Investigators; Karen Adolph is the parent of multiple Affiliate investigators who have broad access to volumes Dr. Adolph has created. Further details about how Authorized Investigators assign access permission to Affiliates can be found in the Principal System Roles section below.\n\n\nSharing Release Levels\nRestricted data and metadata are controlled by a specific set of sharing release levels (https://databrary.org/support/irb/release-levels.html). These levels apply at the session/slot and file/asset level. Newly uploaded files default to Private. The terminology associated with these levels, the icons used to identify the levels, and the level of user access permitted by the levels are deeply embedded in the Databrary policy framework.\n\n\nAPI\nAll Databrary frontend calls use the API. The volume/slot/asset identifier scheme described previously supports API calls of the following form:\nhttps://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1/slot/9807?asset=9200\nThis call accesses the Databrary “leaf” logo in volume 1, slot (session) 9807, with asset ID 9200. Similarly, https://nyu.databrary.org/party/12 returns information about all of the Authorized Investigators who are authorized through party 12, The Pennsylvania State University.\nMost, but not all of the Databrary API is documented. If it is necessary to change the API calls in the rewrite, then the API should be versioned, and the new system should support current API calls.\n\n\nBackend Services\nAll audio and video files uploaded automatically generate transcoding jobs that are handled by the NYU HPC.\nThe system mints a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) when a volume is shared. This must continue. Databrary piggybacks on the DOI account controlled by NYU Libraries.\nThe system generates and updates standard bibliographic citations for a volume based on volume data and metadata.\n\n\nSystem roles\n\nSuper user\nThe system supports a small number of Super User accounts. Only an existing Super User can grant Super User privileges to another account holder. Super User have the following privileges:\n\nEditing user (party) account information\nChanging a user’s parent (sponsor) and child (affiliate) links\nGranting or removing system-wide access privileges\nResetting user passwords\nMonitoring and managing the health of the system as a whole, including restarting stalled video transcoding jobs via an admin dashboard\nGenerating email related to the process for requesting authorization from an institution for specific users\n\n\n\nUser\nThe system supports user accounts with the following features and privileges:\n\nAccount creation\nRequesting authorization from an institution or individual (party)\nEditing user profile information (ORCID, web site, social media, additional email accounts, department)\nTwo tiers of access: Authorized Investigators and Affiliates (Affiliates replaced by new term: Sponsored Researchers)\n\nAuthorized Investigators are specifically linked to an authorizing institution (party) when the Super User establishes that link. Authorized Investigators can:\n\nCreate, edit, share, and unshare volumes\nCreate, edit, and delete sessions (slots) in volumes they own or co-own\nUpload, download, modify, and delete files (assets) in sessions in volumes they own or co-own\nModify which other users (Authorized Investigators or Sponsored Researchers) have access to a volume, session (slot), or file (asset); this includes removing access.\nWith regard to x* (formerly Affiliates), Authorized Investigators determine:\n\nThe Sponsored Researcher’s level of access to all of Databrary (no access or full access to shared data)\nThe Sponsored Researcher’s level of access to the Authorized Investigator’s data (no access; read-only access; read/write access; manager access)\n\nModify the level (sharing release level) assigned to a session (slot) or file (asset)\n\nSponsored Researchers (formerly Affiliates) privileges to access restricted data on Databrary are specifically linked to one or more Authorized Investigators. The Authorized Investigator controls that link. Links should expire on a regular (timed) basis. When linked to an Authorized Investigator, Sponsored Researchers have the level of access granted by that Authorized Investigator to i) Databrary as a whole (default is none) and ii) to specific volumes owned by the Authorized Investigator.",

Databrary’s mission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and related data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral, educational, and neural sciences.\nThe responsibility for protecting research data and research participants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates, Institutions, and Databrary.\nDatabrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video and related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is restricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by their Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of Authorized Investigators through a research ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S. Government (see: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html). Authorized Investigators who share data with others must secure permission to share from research participants and record that permission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized Investigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other Authorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles, including respect for the sharing permissions granted by research participants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights of research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data.",

GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the European Economic Area (EEA).\nDatabrary’s servers are currently located in the United States, and data stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and re-used by Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the EEA. There are more than 500 Institutions across the globe that have signed the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of Authorized Investigators who have access to shared research data at https://nyu.databrary.org/search?volume=false&f.party_authorization=4&f.party_is_institution=false.\nIn seeking permission to collect data from research participants governed by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants information about who may have access to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored. Institutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that satisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of GDPR.\nDatabrary does not typically store information that links a person’s identity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between the Authorized Investigator, the Institution, and Databrary to store this type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy of data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal data that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or Institution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary. Also, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other Authorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who accessed a participant’s personal data prior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants that there are limits to a participant’s right to modify or delete personal data that have already been shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains language for this purpose.\nWhen accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators, Institutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have given in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR provisions.",

Instead, it should contain information regarding the context of data collection and the types of data uploaded (e.g. video, pictures, programming code).\n\n“This dataset includes videos of real-life falls experienced by older adult residents of long-term care homes.” is more useful than “Researchers can study complex developmental phenomena with all the inherent noise and complexity or simplify behaviors to hone in on the essential aspects of a phenomenon.”\nUseful description of data set:\nThis qualitative study interviewed 22 adult residents of two Boston-area communities, to find out about their difficulties paying water utility bills, the coping strategies they rely on to manage unaffordable water bills, and associated health effects. The dataset includes:\n\n22 interview transcripts (RTF files)\nParticipant attribute table\n\nCode book\n\nAdditional sentence to be added if entire volume is not shared: Requests for sharing will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Please contact person@university.edu for all inquiries and requests regarding this dataset.\nAbstract can be added as supplemental information but should not be the only thing in the description.\nAdd year(s) when data was collected\n\n\n\n\nExternal links\nVolumes should have external links to the following:\n\nThe journal article (if it’s been published)\nThe parent volume\nOther DB volumes that use the parent volume data (ex. the many LEGO projects)\nProject website (ex. PLAY project volume should link to PLAY website)\n\n\n\nOrganizing the data itself\n\nIndividual sessions folders for each participant’s video data\n\nDo not share birth date or test date publicly but can share age, gender, race, ethnicity, language, group, tasks, and context (lab/home, state, country)\nIf pulling videos from a “parent” volume, should researchers re-download and re-upload the videos? Or just keep them in the parent volume and link out to that said volume?\n\nExemplar folder with videos that are public. If public permissoin is not explicitly given, blurred out faces of participants.\nCoding spreadsheet/datavyu folder with csv files from all participants. The same level of permission granted from each participant should reflect on the associated spreadsheet.\nSeparate folder for coding manual.

Date of birth is already on the Databrary volume.

Children came from diverse backgrounds (African-American, Dominican, Mexican, Chinese) and lived in the New York City metro area. Videos were recorded during various activities and tasks specific to each observation age (e.g., book reading, mother-child free play, novel toy, familiar toy at the 14-month visit) in children’s homes or in the laboratory at 14, 24, 36, 52, 64, and 76 months of age.”\nLEGO: The project includes a corpus of 234 hours of video recording (across 2 days, 2 hours per visit) of infants and mothers going about their daily routines. We video coded foundational passes on infant object play, motor play, and language behaviours, thereby producing rich descriptive data on how infants play, how play changes across the course of a day and the second year, and which environmental and social factors support infant play. This project yields several valuable products that are disseminated to and shared with the scientific community, parents, and other stakeholders.",
