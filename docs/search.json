Groups of data files related to a specific person or people (or non-human animal), a date, time, and location are grouped into sessions (slots) within a volume. Individual files (assets) of varying types are organized within a session (slot). Sessions (slots) and files (assets) are assigned system-wide unique (integer) identifiers.\nIndividual users and institutions (called parties) are assigned system-wide unique identifiers and have some overlapping data elements (e.g., prename, sortname). Access privileges are granted hierarchically in a parent/child organization. For example, Databrary is the parent of New York University (NYU); NYU is the parent of Karen Adolph and multiple other Authorized Investigators; Karen Adolph is the parent of multiple Affiliate investigators who have broad access to volumes Dr. Adolph has created. Further details about how Authorized Investigators assign access permission to Affiliates can be found in the Principal System Roles section below.\n\n\nSharing Release Levels\nRestricted data and metadata are controlled by a specific set of sharing release levels (https://databrary.org/support/irb/release-levels.html). These levels apply at the session/slot and file/asset level. Newly uploaded files default to Private. The terminology associated with these levels, the icons used to identify the levels, and the level of user access permitted by the levels are deeply embedded in the Databrary policy framework.\n\n\nAPI\nAll Databrary frontend calls use the API. The volume/slot/asset identifier scheme described previously supports API calls of the following form:\nhttps://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1/slot/9807?asset=9200\nThis call accesses the Databrary “leaf” logo in volume 1, slot (session) 9807, with asset ID 9200. Similarly, https://nyu.databrary.org/party/12 returns information about all of the Authorized Investigators who are authorized through party 12, The Pennsylvania State University.\nMost, but not all of the Databrary API is documented. If it is necessary to change the API calls in the rewrite, then the API should be versioned, and the new system should support current API calls.\n\n\nBackend Services\nAll audio and video files uploaded automatically generate transcoding jobs that are handled by the NYU HPC.\nThe system mints a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) when a volume is shared. This must continue. Databrary piggybacks on the DOI account controlled by NYU Libraries.\nThe system generates and updates standard bibliographic citations for a volume based on volume data and metadata.\n\n\nSystem roles\n\nSuper user\nThe system supports a small number of Super User accounts. Only an existing Super User can grant Super User privileges to another account holder. Super User have the following privileges:\n\nEditing user (party) account information\nChanging a user’s parent (sponsor) and child (affiliate) links\nGranting or removing system-wide access privileges\nResetting user passwords\nMonitoring and managing the health of the system as a whole, including restarting stalled video transcoding jobs via an admin dashboard\nGenerating email related to the process for requesting authorization from an institution for specific users\n\n\n\nUser\nThe system supports user accounts with the following features and privileges:\n\nAccount creation\nRequesting authorization from an institution or individual (party)\nEditing user profile information (ORCID, web site, social media, additional email accounts, department)\nTwo tiers of access: Authorized Investigators and Affiliates (Affiliates replaced by new term: Sponsored Researchers)\n\nAuthorized Investigators are specifically linked to an authorizing institution (party) when the Super User establishes that link. Authorized Investigators can:\n\nCreate, edit, share, and unshare volumes\nCreate, edit, and delete sessions (slots) in volumes they own or co-own\nUpload, download, modify, and delete files (assets) in sessions in volumes they own or co-own\nModify which other users (Authorized Investigators or Sponsored Researchers) have access to a volume, session (slot), or file (asset); this includes removing access.\nWith regard to x* (formerly Affiliates), Authorized Investigators determine:\n\nThe Sponsored Researcher’s level of access to all of Databrary (no access or full access to shared data)\nThe Sponsored Researcher’s level of access to the Authorized Investigator’s data (no access; read-only access; read/write access; manager access)\n\nModify the level (sharing release level) assigned to a session (slot) or file (asset)\n\nSponsored Researchers (formerly Affiliates) privileges to access restricted data on Databrary are specifically linked to one or more Authorized Investigators. The Authorized Investigator controls that link. Links should expire on a regular (timed) basis. When linked to an Authorized Investigator, Sponsored Researchers have the level of access granted by that Authorized Investigator to i) Databrary as a whole (default is none) and ii) to specific volumes owned by the Authorized Investigator.",

Databrary’s mission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and related data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral, educational, and neural sciences.\nThe responsibility for protecting research data and research participants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates, Institutions, and Databrary.\nDatabrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video and related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is restricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by their Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of Authorized Investigators through a research ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S. Government (see: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html). Authorized Investigators who share data with others must secure permission to share from research participants and record that permission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized Investigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other Authorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles, including respect for the sharing permissions granted by research participants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights of research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data.",

GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the European Economic Area (EEA).\nDatabrary’s servers are currently located in the United States, and data stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and re-used by Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the EEA. There are more than 500 Institutions across the globe that have signed the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of Authorized Investigators who have access to shared research data at https://nyu.databrary.org/search?volume=false&f.party_authorization=4&f.party_is_institution=false.\nIn seeking permission to collect data from research participants governed by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants information about who may have access to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored. Institutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that satisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of GDPR.\nDatabrary does not typically store information that links a person’s identity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between the Authorized Investigator, the Institution, and Databrary to store this type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy of data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal data that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or Institution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary. Also, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other Authorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who accessed a participant’s personal data prior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants that there are limits to a participant’s right to modify or delete personal data that have already been shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains language for this purpose.\nWhen accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators, Institutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have given in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR provisions.",

Children came from diverse backgrounds (African-American, Dominican, Mexican, Chinese) and lived in the New York City metro area. Videos were recorded during various activities and tasks specific to each observation age (e.g., book reading, mother-child free play, novel toy, familiar toy at the 14-month visit) in children’s homes or in the laboratory at 14, 24, 36, 52, 64, and 76 months of age.”\nLEGO: The project includes a corpus of 234 hours of video recording (across 2 days, 2 hours per visit) of infants and mothers going about their daily routines. We video coded foundational passes on infant object play, motor play, and language behaviours, thereby producing rich descriptive data on how infants play, how play changes across the course of a day and the second year, and which environmental and social factors support infant play. This project yields several valuable products that are disseminated to and shared with the scientific community, parents, and other stakeholders.",

This document is intended to help researchers who plan to store and share video data in Databrary prepare IRB materials for approval.\nResearchers should confirm institution/agency/directorate/program-specific application requirements before submission.\nPlease contact us at contact@databrary.org for further assistance.\n\nSecondary Reuse\nThis project will conduct secondary analyses of participant data obtained from Databrary, an online platform for the storage, sharing, and re-use of video and other research data. Participants’ consent for study participation and release of data were obtained by the original researcher under the oversight of their institutional review board. Because there is no direct contact with participants as a part of this project, the level of additional risk to participants is low.\n\n\nPrimary data collection\nData will be handled by the team of researchers approved on the IRB protocols of all Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators. Data are linked to participants by subject ID. However, video data are potentially identifiable because participants’ faces are visible and their names may be heard. With participant consent, study data will be stored on Databrary, a secure web-based video library housed at NYU, allowing permission-based access to coders from all labs comprising the project team. At the end of each lab visit, caregivers will be asked whether they are comfortable: 1) storing their videos and children’s birthdates and other metadata on Databrary, and 2) sharing their data with authorized researchers outside of this protocol who are members of the academic research and clinical communities authorized to access Databrary. If caregivers agree to video sharing, the videos will be made available to authorized researchers as outlined below. If caregivers do not agree, their videos will be accessible only by researchers on the project protocol and not shared with the larger community. The policies for sharing videos and other potentially identifiable data on Databrary have been carefully developed and monitored with the advice of the legal counsel, grants/contracts office, and IRBs of both New York University and The Pennsylvania State University. Currently, more than 360 institutions in the U.S. and around the world have formally approved the Databrary Access Agreement to enable video sharing and reuse. Parents also will be told that they can share portions of data or ask for particular sessions not to be shared while sharing other sessions.\n\n\nPolicies for Databrary access and data sharing\nSensitive or identifiable data shared with Databrary will only be viewable to and downloadable by authorized users who have been granted secure access by Databrary’s administrators. Select data may be made available to the public, but only as determined by the researcher and on the basis of participant permission. Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, and researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators and under their supervision, are authorized for access.\nAuthorized users are required to sign a user access agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories.\nOnly videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording are made available to the community of authorized Databrary users. In consultation with ethics board officials at New York University and the Pennsylvania State University, Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data.\nFederal policies do not require re-consenting of minor participants when they reach the age of majority, if re-consenting is impractical or otherwise increases risks to participants (e.g., by requiring researchers to maintain links between identifiable information and collected data for extended time periods).\n\n\nPolicies and provisions for reuse and redistribution\nAccess to videos and metadata will be available for educational and research purposes, subject to participant consent. Such access will be provided using the Databrary web-based application. Materials generated under the project will be disseminated in accordance with the policies of [GRANT-GIVING ORGANIZATION] and participating institutions. Publication of data shall occur during the project, if appropriate, or at the end of the project, consistent with normal scientific practices.\n\n\nArchiving and preservation of research data\nData in Databrary will be preserved indefinitely in a secure data storage facility at New York University (NYU); the facility is managed by the university’s Information Technology Services department. Central IT staff handle storage, network, and backup systems. NYU does routine tape backups that are stored off site and performs regular file fixity checks to monitor the integrity of stored assets. Federal regulations do not require that data be destroyed after a particular time period if they are stored indefinitely in a recognized repository.\n\n\nData Security\nData and metadata stored in Databrary are subject to the security policies and best practices implemented by NYU. For more information about these policies and services, please visit NYU ITS Computer & Network Security at https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/cybersecurity.html.",

This document is intended to help researchers who plan to store and share video data in Databrary prepare grant materials for submission. The material here is particularly suited to NSF application requirements, but similar language can be adapted for NIH grants as well as private foundations. Please contact us at contact@databrary.org for further assistance.\nResearchers should confirm institution/agency/directorate/program-specific resource sharing plan or data management plan requirements.\n\n\nData Formats\nDatabrary transcodes all deposited video data into standard and HTML5-compatible formats, currently H.264+AAC as MP4. It stores the original video file along with the transformed, web accessible video file. Databrary stores other data in their original formats (e.g., .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .csv, .pdf, .jpg, .png). As standards for preferred video file formats change over time, Databrary will perform file format migrations to those preferred formats.\n\n\nMetadata\nDatabrary takes and stores metadata related to a full dataset (e.g., title, authors, related publication, description of study, keywords or tags, associated URLs), individual study sessions (e.g. metadata related to participants, study groups and conditions, location, language, and session date and tasks), and video files (e.g., title, duration, tags) related to a dataset. Metadata is added through a user-friendly web interface where auto-completion, suggested terms, and integration with third party services (e.g., CrossRef) guide users through its creation. Metadata may be accessed through the web interface, via API, or downloaded as a comma separated values (CSV) file.\n\n\nDocumentation\nData owners can upload and store on Databrary any number of related documents that assist other researchers in understanding their data (e.g. study protocol, coding manuals, output from video coding software, and procedural videos). These documents can be associated with the dataset as a whole, or with individual sessions within the dataset.\n\n\nPolicies for access and sharing\nData will be stored with, and shared through, Databrary. Researchers are asked to avoid the inclusion of extraneous personally identifiable information (PII) in videos uploaded to Databrary. However, given the nature of video, it might still be possible to identify individuals based on first names, facial features, or details of the environment. Because of this, sensitive or identifiable data shared with Databrary will only be viewable and downloadable to authorized users who have been granted secure access by Databrary’s administrators. Select data may be made available to the public, but only as determined by the researcher and on the basis of participant permission. Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, or researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators, will be authorized for access.\nAuthorized users will be required to sign a user agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories.\nAlthough Databrary will store complete study data, only videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording will be made available to the community of authorized users. Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data.\nData owners can choose to share their data at any point, either as they collect their data, or only once data collection has completed.\n\n\nPolicies and provisions for reuse and redistribution\nAccess to videos and metadata will be available for educational and research purposes, subject to participant consent.

The facility is managed by the university’s Information Technology Services department. Central IT staff handle storage, network, and backup systems. NYU does routine tape backups that are stored off site and performs regular file fixity checks to monitor the integrity of stored assets.\n\n\nVersioning of stored assets\nFiles uploaded to Databrary are assigned a unique identifier and have metadata associating them to files that are uploaded to replace them.

Data repositories and libraries like data are permanent homes for sharing research data. And sharing research data is a vital component of the research process like publishing papers and books, giving talks, and teaching classes.\nOn a more practical level, videos are expensive and time consuming to collect. It’s possible, maybe even likely depending on what your videos recorded that another researcher could answer their research questions with videos you’ve already collected.\nFinally, many granting agencies that fund research require that research data be shared. So, by sharing data on Databrary, you’ll not only accelerate discovery, but you’ll also meet an important obligation to research sponsors and often taxpapers who fund them.",

    "section": "Does Databrary offer “blind review”?",
    "text": "Does Databrary offer “blind review”?\nDatabrary is a restricted access data repository that promotes the storage and sharing of identifiable and sensitive data. As such, Databrary has unique policies to protect the privacy of research participants. These policies govern who can access identifiable data and under what circumstances. The policies are codified in a formal access agreement that binds NYU, Databrary’s parent institution, and similar institutions where Databrary’s users conduct research. For the forseeable future, these policies make it impossible to support full double-blinded anonymous review of data and materials.\nWhile some data and materials are shared with the public, Databrary restricts access to sensitive and identifiable information to people who have received authorization from an institution or to those whose access is supervised by an authorized investigator. Only authorized investigators can create and share datasets. Dataset creators, not Databrary, determine what level of sharing is appropriate for individual data files and for datasets as a whole.\nSo, the level of access a reviewer can have to a dataset depends on two things: Has the dataset been shared with the Databrary community? Does the reviewer have authorization from an institution to view restricted data or materials?\nIf both answers are yes, the reviewer may fully vet a shared dataset. Databrary does not report on access to specific datasets, so the reviewer can remain anonymous. Databrary does not mask the identities of dataset owners, so the blinding is only one-way.\nIf the dataset is shared, but the reviewer does not have authorization from an institution, the reviewer can confirm that a shared dataset exists, that the dataset has a persistent identifier, and that the dataset has a specific number of shared restricted access files. The reviewer may also examine any items that are shared with the public, stimuli, protocol, aggregated and de-identified datasets, etc.",

This allows for use of an API pull to ingest data when necessary.\nAfter all data are collected, a new volume with ALL of the final data, including which data are from which site, can be created.",
