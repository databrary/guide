Groups of data files related to a specific person or people (or non-human animal), a date, time, and location are grouped into sessions (slots) within a volume. Individual files (assets) of varying types are organized within a session (slot). Sessions (slots) and files (assets) are assigned system-wide unique (integer) identifiers.\nIndividual users and institutions (called parties) are assigned system-wide unique identifiers and have some overlapping data elements (e.g., prename, sortname). Access privileges are granted hierarchically in a parent/child organization. For example, Databrary is the parent of New York University (NYU); NYU is the parent of Karen Adolph and multiple other Authorized Investigators; Karen Adolph is the parent of multiple Affiliate investigators who have broad access to volumes Dr. Adolph has created. Further details about how Authorized Investigators assign access permission to Affiliates can be found in the System Roles section below.\n\n\nSharing Release Levels\nRestricted data and metadata are controlled by a specific set of sharing release levels. These levels apply at the session/slot and file/asset level. Newly uploaded files default to Private. The terminology associated with these levels, the icons used to identify the levels, and the level of user access permitted by the levels are deeply embedded in the Databrary policy framework.\n\n : Unknown\n : Private\n : Shared\n : Learning Audiences\n : Public\n\n\n\nAPI\nAll Databrary frontend calls use the API. The volume/slot/asset identifier scheme described previously supports API calls of the following form:\nhttps://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1/slot/9807?asset=9200\nThis call accesses the Databrary “leaf” logo in volume 1, slot (session) 9807, with asset ID 9200. Similarly, https://nyu.databrary.org/party/12 returns information about all of the Authorized Investigators who are authorized through party 12, The Pennsylvania State University.\nMost, but not all of the Databrary API is documented. If it is necessary to change the API calls in the rewrite, then the API should be versioned, and the new system should support current API calls.\n\n\nBackend Services\nAll audio and video files uploaded automatically generate transcoding jobs that are handled by the NYU HPC.\nThe system mints a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) when a volume is shared. This must continue. Databrary piggybacks on the DOI account controlled by NYU Libraries.\nThe system generates and updates standard bibliographic citations for a volume based on volume data and metadata.\n\n\nSystem roles\n\nSuper user\nThe system supports a small number of Super User accounts. Only an existing Super User can grant Super User privileges to another account holder. Super User have the following privileges:\n\nEditing user (party) account information\nChanging a user’s parent (sponsor) and child (affiliate) links\nGranting or removing system-wide access privileges\nResetting user passwords\nMonitoring and managing the health of the system as a whole, including restarting stalled video transcoding jobs via an admin dashboard\nGenerating email related to the process for requesting authorization from an institution for specific users\n\n\n\nUser\nThe system supports user accounts with the following features and privileges:\n\nAccount creation\nRequesting authorization from an institution or individual (party)\nEditing user profile information (ORCID, web site, social media, additional email accounts, department)\nTwo tiers of access: Authorized Investigators and Affiliates.1.\n\nAuthorized Investigators are specifically linked to an authorizing institution (party) when the Super User establishes that link. Authorized Investigators can:\n\nCreate, edit, share, and unshare volumes\nCreate, edit, and delete sessions (slots) in volumes they own or co-own\nUpload, download, modify, and delete files (assets) in sessions in volumes they own or co-own\nModify which other users (Authorized Investigators or Affiliates) have access to a volume, session (slot), or file (asset); this includes removing access.\nWith regard to Affiliate, Authorized Investigators determine:\n\nThe Affiliate’s level of access to all of Databrary (no access or full access to shared data)\nThe Affiliate’s level of access to the Authorized Investigator’s data (no access; read-only access; read/write access; manager access)\n\nModify the level (sharing release level) assigned to a session (slot) or file (asset)\n\nAffiliates privileges to access restricted data on Databrary are specifically linked to one or more Authorized Investigators. The Authorized Investigator controls that link. Links should expire on a regular (timed) basis. When linked to an Authorized Investigator, Affiliates have the level of access granted by that Authorized Investigator to i) Databrary as a whole (default is none) and ii) to specific volumes owned by the Authorized Investigator.\n\n\n\n\n\nVolume Sharing Levels\n\nSee more-information/definitions.\n: Private (to research collaborators):\n: Volume Overview\n: Entire Volume Shared (with the public)\n\nAn Authorized Investigator has a private page that combines personal profile information and a dashboard with information about volumes, sponsors, and affiliates.\n\n\n\nRick Gilmore’s private profile and dashboard.\n\n\nThe Dashboard consists of two columns. The left column provides information about Volumes the Authorized Investigator has created or has access to.\nThe following figure illustrates that the Volume has “Entire Volume Shared” status (unlocked lock icon; “Share Entire Volume” tooltip).\n Also, on this Volume, the user has “Investigator” status, meaning that the data can be fully edited and shared with others, as indicated by the tooltip and the crown icon):\n\nSome volumes are Private (locked lock icon), accessible only to the researcher and specific Affiliates (network icon).\n\n\nThis user also has volumes with Volume Overview Shared as indicated by the keyhole icon:\n\nSome other Authorized Investigators have also given this user read-write (pencil icon) status to their volumes that have Volume Overview Shared status:\n\nAnd still other Authorized Investigators have given this user read-only (eyeglasses icon) privileges:\n\nIn this case, it looks like the volume has been fully shared (unlocked lock icon), so the user has full read access to the volume already. Prior to the volume being fully shared, the user had read-only access to the private data.\n\n\nUser Access Privileges\n The Authorized Investigator determines what access an Affiliate has1. Other researcher’s (shared) data on Databrary and 2. the Authorized Investigator’s (shared and private) data.\nAffiliate access expires after a user-defined date.\n\nAffiliate access to other’s data\n\nNo access (default)\nAffiliate\n\n\n\nAffiliate access to an Authorized Investigator*’s data\nA user may be given privileges to a Volume by an Authorized Investigator.\n\nNo access (default)\nView and access only public data (Level visible only to Super User; probably should deprecate or eliminate.)\nView and access only shared data: (Level visible only to Super User; probably should deprecate or eliminate.)\nRead-only access\nRead/write access\nManager\n\nRead, write, create volumes, and change volume access (change sharing)\nExtend privileges to Affiliates.",

    "text": "What is Databrary?\nDatabrary is a restricted access data library specialized for storing, streaming, and sharing of video and audio recordings. Databrary’s mission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and related data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral, educational, and neural sciences.\nThe responsibility for protecting research data and research participants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates, Institutions, and Databrary.\nDatabrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video and related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is restricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by their Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of Authorized Investigators through a research ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S. Government (see: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html). Authorized Investigators who share data with others must secure permission to share from research participants and record that permission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized Investigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other Authorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles, including respect for the sharing permissions granted by research participants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights of research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data.",

Unlike data use agreements that allow specific individuals access to a particular dataset for a discrete research purpose, the Databrary Access Agreement allows any Authorized Investigator to access all shared datasets on Databrary and use the datasets for many different Institutionally-approved purposes. In addition, the Databrary Access Agreement permits Authorized Investigators to upload data and to share it with other Authorized Investigators in accord with the sharing permissions granted by participants and any required Institutional approvals.

The Sharing Release Template is one of the resources that Databrary has made available to researchers. The Sharing Release Template may be adapted for use at any Institution and added to any research ethics or IRB protocol. However, an Institution may require other release language in order to provide equivalent protections.\nWhether de-identified or pseudonymized data may be shared with Databrary without seeking explicit permission from research participants depends on the Authorized Investigator’s Institution. Some ethics boards or IRBs may allow de-identified or pseudonymized data to be shared without the explicit permission of the research participant.",

An Authorized Investigator may elect to create an overview of a dataset when it is created and make the overview publicly available. The overview can serve as the public face of the dataset while the dataset is being collected and analyzed. This can be useful in documenting progress on a research grant to sponsors.

GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the European Economic Area (EEA).\nDatabrary’s servers are currently located in the United States, and data stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and re-used by Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the EEA. There are more than 500 Institutions across the globe that have signed the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of Authorized Investigators who have access to shared research data at this link.\nIn seeking permission to collect data from research participants governed by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants information about who may have access to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored. Institutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that satisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of GDPR.\nDatabrary does not typically store information that links a person’s identity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between the Authorized Investigator, the Institution, and Databrary to store this type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy of data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal data that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or Institution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary. Also, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other Authorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who accessed a participant’s personal data prior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants that there are limits to a participant’s right to modify or delete personal data that have already been shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains language for this purpose.\nWhen accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators, Institutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have given in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR provisions.",

The suspension extends to an Authorized Investigators’ Affiliates. Authorized Investigators will continue to have password-protected access to data they uploaded to Databrary once they leave an Institution. When a new Institution grants authorization, Authorized Investigators will regain access to non-public data shared by other Authorized Investigators.\nIf an Authorized Investigator retires, is incapacitated due to illness, or dies, the Institution should inform Databrary so that the Authorized Investigator’s account may be suspended. An Institution may choose to designate a data steward for the Authorized Investigator’s data and authorize that person to manage access to the data. If the Institution does not identify and authorize a data steward, Databrary staff will serve that role.

Children came from diverse backgrounds (African-American, Dominican, Mexican, Chinese) and lived in the New York City metro area. Videos were recorded during various activities and tasks specific to each observation age (e.g., book reading, mother-child free play, novel toy, familiar toy at the 14-month visit) in children’s homes or in the laboratory at 14, 24, 36, 52, 64, and 76 months of age.”\nLEGO: The project includes a corpus of 234 hours of video recording (across 2 days, 2 hours per visit) of infants and mothers going about their daily routines. We video coded foundational passes on infant object play, motor play, and language behaviours, thereby producing rich descriptive data on how infants play, how play changes across the course of a day and the second year, and which environmental and social factors support infant play.

This document is intended to help researchers who plan to store and share video data in Databrary prepare IRB materials for approval.\nResearchers should confirm institution/agency/directorate/program-specific application requirements before submission.\nPlease contact us at contact@databrary.org for further assistance.\n\nSecondary Reuse\nThis project will conduct secondary analyses of participant data obtained from Databrary, an online platform for the storage, sharing, and re-use of video and other research data. Participants’ consent for study participation and release of data were obtained by the original researcher under the oversight of their institutional review board. Because there is no direct contact with participants as a part of this project, the level of additional risk to participants is low.\n\n\nPrimary data collection\nData will be handled by the team of researchers approved on the IRB protocols of all Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators. Data are linked to participants by subject ID. However, video data are potentially identifiable because participants’ faces are visible and their names may be heard. With participant consent, study data will be stored on Databrary, a secure web-based video library housed at NYU, allowing permission-based access to coders from all labs comprising the project team. At the end of each lab visit, caregivers will be asked whether they are comfortable: 1) storing their videos and children’s birthdates and other metadata on Databrary, and 2) sharing their data with authorized researchers outside of this protocol who are members of the academic research and clinical communities authorized to access Databrary. If caregivers agree to video sharing, the videos will be made available to authorized researchers as outlined below. If caregivers do not agree, their videos will be accessible only by researchers on the project protocol and not shared with the larger community. The policies for sharing videos and other potentially identifiable data on Databrary have been carefully developed and monitored with the advice of the legal counsel, grants/contracts office, and IRBs of both New York University and The Pennsylvania State University. Currently, more than 360 institutions in the U.S. and around the world have formally approved the Databrary Access Agreement to enable video sharing and reuse. Parents also will be told that they can share portions of data or ask for particular sessions not to be shared while sharing other sessions.\n\n\nPolicies for Databrary access and data sharing\nSensitive or identifiable data shared with Databrary will only be viewable to and downloadable by authorized users who have been granted secure access by Databrary’s administrators. Select data may be made available to the public, but only as determined by the researcher and on the basis of participant permission. Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, and researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators and under their supervision, are authorized for access.\nAuthorized users are required to sign a user access agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories.\nOnly videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording are made available to the community of authorized Databrary users. In consultation with ethics board officials at New York University and the Pennsylvania State University, Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data.\nFederal policies do not require re-consenting of minor participants when they reach the age of majority, if re-consenting is impractical or otherwise increases risks to participants (e.g., by requiring researchers to maintain links between identifiable information and collected data for extended time periods).\n\n\nPolicies and provisions for reuse and redistribution\nAccess to videos and metadata will be available for educational and research purposes, subject to participant consent.

    "text": "Grants\nMany users want to know how to incorporate data sharing using Databrary in funding proposals to agencies like the U.S. National Science Foundation or National Institutes of Health.\nResearchers should confirm funding agency, directorate, or program-specific resource sharing plans or data management plan requirements.\n\nData Management Plan Template\nBelow is boilerplate language prepared by Databrary that researchers can use to help draft data management or resource sharing plans. This document is intended to help researchers who plan to store and share video data in Databrary prepare grant materials for submission. The material here is particularly suited to NSF application requirements, but similar language can be adapted for NIH grants as well as private foundations. Please contact us at contact@databrary.org for further assistance.\nResearchers should confirm institution/agency/directorate/program-specific resource sharing plan or data management plan requirements.\n\n\nData Formats\nDatabrary transcodes all deposited video data into standard and HTML5-compatible formats, currently H.264+AAC as MP4. It stores the original video file along with the transformed, web accessible video file. Databrary stores other data in their original formats (e.g., .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .csv, .pdf, .jpg, .png). As standards for preferred video file formats change over time, Databrary will perform file format migrations to those preferred formats.\n\n\nMetadata\nDatabrary takes and stores metadata related to a full dataset (e.g., title, authors, related publication, description of study, keywords or tags, associated URLs), individual study sessions (e.g. metadata related to participants, study groups and conditions, location, language, and session date and tasks), and video files (e.g., title, duration, tags) related to a dataset. Metadata is added through a user-friendly web interface where auto-completion, suggested terms, and integration with third party services (e.g., CrossRef) guide users through its creation. Metadata may be accessed through the web interface, via API, or downloaded as a comma separated values (CSV) file.\n\n\nDocumentation\nData owners can upload and store on Databrary any number of related documents that assist other researchers in understanding their data (e.g. study protocol, coding manuals, output from video coding software, and procedural videos). These documents can be associated with the dataset as a whole, or with individual sessions within the dataset.\n\n\nPolicies for access and sharing\nData will be stored with, and shared through, Databrary. Researchers are asked to avoid the inclusion of extraneous personally identifiable information (PII) in videos uploaded to Databrary. However, given the nature of video, it might still be possible to identify individuals based on first names, facial features, or details of the environment. Because of this, sensitive or identifiable data shared with Databrary will only be viewable and downloadable to authorized users who have been granted secure access by Databrary’s administrators. Select data may be made available to the public, but only as determined by the researcher and on the basis of participant permission. Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, or researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators, will be authorized for access.\nAuthorized users will be required to sign a user agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories.\nAlthough Databrary will store complete study data, only videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording will be made available to the community of authorized users. Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data.\nData owners can choose to share their data at any point, either as they collect their data, or only once data collection has completed.\n\n\nPolicies and provisions for reuse and redistribution\nAccess to videos and metadata will be available for educational and research purposes, subject to participant consent. Such access will be provided using the Databrary web-based application. Materials generated under the project will be disseminated in accordance with the policies of [GRANT-GIVING ORGANIZATION] and participating institutions. Publication of data shall occur during the project, if appropriate, or at the end of the project, consistent with normal scientific practices.\n\n\nPlans for archiving and preservation\nData in Databrary will be preserved indefinitely in a secure data storage facility at New York University (NYU). The facility is managed by the university’s Information Technology Services department. Central IT staff handle storage, network, and backup systems. NYU does routine tape backups that are stored off site and performs regular file fixity checks to monitor the integrity of stored assets.\n\n\nVersioning of stored assets\nFiles uploaded to Databrary are assigned a unique identifier and have metadata associating them to files that are uploaded to replace them. Though only the latest version of a file is exposed to Databrary site users. Files, once uploaded, are never deleted.\n\n\nData Security\nData and metadata stored in Databrary are subject to the security policies and best practices implemented by NYU.

Data repositories and libraries provide permanent homes for research findings and raw data. Sharing research data is a vital component of the research process just like publishing papers and books, giving talks, and teaching classes.\nOn a more practical level, videos are expensive and time consuming to collect. It’s possible, maybe even likely depending on what your videos recorded that another researcher could answer their research questions with videos you’ve already collected.\nFinally, many granting agencies that fund research require that research data be shared.

    "section": "Does Databrary offer “blind review”?",
    "text": "Does Databrary offer “blind review”?\nDatabrary is a restricted access data repository that promotes the storage and sharing of identifiable and sensitive data. As such, Databrary has unique policies to protect the privacy of research participants. These policies govern who can access identifiable data and under what circumstances. The policies are codified in a formal access agreement that binds NYU, Databrary’s parent institution, and similar institutions where Databrary’s users conduct research. For the forseeable future, these policies make it impossible to support full double-blinded anonymous review of data and materials.\nWhile some data and materials are shared with the public, Databrary restricts access to sensitive and identifiable information to people who have received authorization from an institution or to those whose access is supervised by an authorized investigator. Only authorized investigators can create and share datasets. Dataset creators, not Databrary, determine what level of sharing is appropriate for individual data files and for datasets as a whole.\nSo, the level of access a reviewer can have to a dataset depends on two things: Has the dataset been shared with the Databrary community? Does the reviewer have authorization from an institution to view restricted data or materials?\nIf both answers are yes, the reviewer may fully vet a shared dataset. Databrary does not report on access to specific datasets, so the reviewer can remain anonymous. Databrary does not mask the identities of dataset owners, so the blinding is only one-way.\nIf the dataset is shared, but the reviewer does not have authorization from an institution, the reviewer can confirm that a shared dataset exists, that the dataset has a persistent identifier, and that the dataset has a specific number of shared restricted access files. The reviewer may also examine any items that are shared with the public, stimuli, protocol, aggregated and de-identified datasets, etc.",

    "text": "I just uploaded a video file onto Databrary and it says my uploading is complete. Why can’t I see it on or download it from Databrary right away?\nWhen you upload a video or audio file, Databrary converts it (transcodes it) into a common format that should be accessible well into the future. The original file format is stored in parallel. Transcoding videos takes time. Databrary will not show a thumbnail of your file until the transcoding finishes. If your file is especially large, then the wait time could be several hours.\nIf your file takes longer than that, contact Databrary support. Sometimes, transcoding jobs fail, and we can fix the problem at our end.",

    "text": "I downloaded files from Databrary, but the filenames are truncated.\nWhen you download files from the Databrary application, the system appends information about the volume and session the files came from. This is to help you understand what you’ve downloaded. However, when Databrary downloads files there is a 32 character limit to the file name. So, if your file on Databrary has a long name, some of that name may be truncated in the downloaded file. Or, if the file name is too long (the first 32 characters of the filename are exactly the same as another file), it is impossible to distinguish between these files when they download and only one file will be downloaded.\nThere are two solutions:\n\nTry not to create excessively long file names for files stored on Databrary.\nAlternatively, you may want to download and use the databraryr R package. The package includes commands to download files from Databrary with the original (full length) Databrary file names intact. See this section of the databraryr guide for more information.",

    "text": "What is Databrary?\nDatabrary is a restricted access data library specialized for storing, streaming, and sharing of video and audio recordings. Databrary’s mission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and related data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral, educational, and neural sciences.\nThe responsibility for protecting research data and research participants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates, Institutions, and Databrary.\nDatabrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video and related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is restricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by their Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of Authorized Investigators through a research ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S. Government (see: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html). Authorized Investigators who share data with others must secure permission to share from research participants and record that permission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized Investigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other Authorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles, including respect for the sharing permissions granted by research participants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights of research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data."

Right now, the application returns a placeholder image and the user cannot\n\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet\n\n(discuss): (What features of the existing session/slot spreadsheet interface for managing and visualizing demographic data can be implemented easily and at minimal cost using existing libraries?\n\nSee also below section on support for schemas.\n\n\nSecurity\n\nCan two-factor authentication be added? If so, at what cost?3\n\n\n\nAdmin/Superuser\n\n(discuss): Can per-institution (across users and projects), per-user (across projects) or per-project storage quotas be implemented? Can warnings be generated when storage amounts are nearing quotas? How could Super Users manage user requests to increase quotas?\n(discuss): Can a more informative administrative console be developed with by-volume, usage, and storage metrics, including shared vs. unshared data? If so, at what cost?\n\nSee also section below about other administrative upgrades. This will probably get pushed to later.\n\n\nAccess to volumes\n\n(discuss): Volume access expires after a user-defined date that is no longer than one year from the date of the last update.\n\n\n\n\nRoadmap (&gt;2.0)\nThese ideas are on the longer-term roadmap. Some of them may be supported by proposals under review (e.g., HNDS-I or NYU TAC).\n\nSupport for open data schemas\n\nJSON-LD\n\nDatabrary should eventually support standard schemas wherever practical, specifically in the JSON-LD format. These should use Schema.org properties.\nExamples of properties that seem relevant to Databrary include:\n\nPerson\nCreative Work\n\nVideoObject\n\nEvent\n\nFor a data collection session or change in status on the site.\n\nPlace\n\nTesting locations, geographical information, locations of institutions\n\nData Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese examples are not exhaustive.\n\n\n\nBy support, I mean that the application should add relevant schema information to the JSON data provided by the API.\n\n\n\nNIH CDE\n\nDatabrary should also support NIH Common Data Elements (CDEs), especially for “spreadsheet” data elements.\nExamples of CDE properties of a Person\n\nGender: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/formView?tinyId=vx35JcbgJI\nSex at Birth: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=rGEh0ckdmr\nRace: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=Fakc6Jy2x\nRace/Ethnicity Self-Identification: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=LakF0YkywC\nEthnicity: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=PtRlg7yLP_\nDisabilities: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=0md12WGtZXE\nBirth date: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=X1mJv5j3jx.\nList of languages: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=7JDyF9o3ie\n\nLanguage secondary text: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=mJsWHcxje9W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are a set of CDEs that NIH endorses. These should probably be the highest priority.\n\n\n\n(discuss): Should specific data elements be represented in the database schema explicitly? Would doing so make it easier to search and filter data by these characteristics?\n(discuss): Should the database schema support linking data about the same individuals? This would require supporting something like the NIMH GUID, and possibly some additional data sharing consent language that permits data linkage.\n(discuss): Should species and other terms commonly used in non-human animal research be incorporated and supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt does not appear that there are NIH-Endorsed elements that contain the term “species”.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved search and filtering\nIdeas from HNDS-I 2024 proposal:\n\nBroader set of demographic characteristics.\nIndex other text documents (protocols, coding manuals) in materials folders.\n\n\nIndex annotation files, return segments\n\n“Building on this foundation, we will upgrade Databrary to support searching within annotation files linked to videos that tag specific behaviors, utterances, or contexts, starting with the most popular annotation file formats stored on Databrary (Datavyu and CHAT)”\n\n— HNDS-I proposal.\n\n\n\n“Virtual volumes” or custom collections\n\nTo capitalize on enhanced search and filtering and ease data reuse, users must be able to create their own custom collections of video files, video segments, annotations, and other data derived from multiple, primary datasets. The custom collections or “virtual datasets” will link to but not copy parent datasets and their associated metadata.\n\n— HNDS-I proposal.\n\n\nWorkspaces\n\n…We will implement private, flexible, temporary workspaces for datasets that act like folders in cloud storage. Unlike other forms of cloud storage that provide only a temporary home for research data, Databrary’s workspaces will provide a permanent and flexible home that is just a button press away from being made accessible to the broader research community.\n\n– HNDS-I proposal.\n\n\nExpanding scriptable access\n\n…We will build on the free, open-source, R package, databraryr, that PI Gilmore developed with NSF support and openly released to the research community. Databraryr wraps Databrary API calls into commands that are useful to researchers who want to download shared data from Databrary. We will add data uploading capabilities to the R package to support Aim 3, develop and publish a parallel Python package, databrarypy.\n\n– HNDS-I proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nHow do we permit scriptable access while protecting Databrary from unwanted “bot” access?\nSome users find that the web interface times out when they try to download large numbers or large files.\n\n\n\n\nMore flexible downloading\nWhen users select sessions with large numbers or large files, the application creates a zip file. Generating that file consumes central app resources (compute and memory) and can cause long pauses in a user’s experience with the app.\nA better solution would be to create the archive offline and notify the user when it is ready to download.\n\n\nAdministrative panel upgrades\n\nQuotas on per-user, per-institution storage footprints.\nInfrastructure for managing subscriptions, curation assistance, data deposit fees.\nLinks to institutional admin panel functions; data footprint, etc.\n\n\n\nVersion control\nZenodo and OSF implement this.\n\n\nPrivate volumes for peer review\nOSF implements this.\n\n\nSupport for institutional subscriptions\nThese features are described in a proposal submitted to NYU TAC in August 2024.",

Databrary supports sharing of many types of research data and documentation beyond video and audio. Based at New York University, Databrary’s mission is to support data sharing among researchers in the behavioral, social, educational, developmental, neural, and computer sciences.\nDatabrary is also a resource for and a community of scientists who use video or audio in their research or teaching.\nWe encourage you to read Databrary’s Access Agreement and its three annexes. These documents, especially Annex III–Databrary Access Guide, provide extensive information about how Databrary is structured and how it should be used. You may also get guidance about working with a research ethics board or IRB or see how to incorporate data sharing using Databrary in a Data Management Plan for a grant proposal. Look up a term in the glossary if something doesn’t make sense, or contact us directly for one-on-one support.\nThe guide has separate sections specifically for institutions, researchers, and trainees or staff.",

If a researcher meets the qualifications for getting authorized through their institution, they should secure that authorization.\nAffiliates have access to Databrary only through the sponsorship of an Authorized Investigator.\nNote: Databrary 1.0 permitted some Affiliates to be granted access without a direct sponsorship by a specific Authorized Investigator. Individuals who previously had read/write access to some of your volumes may no longer have that access in Databrary 2.0. To grant these individuals access, you must specifically (re)authorize them as your Affiliate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Screenshot of a user’s (private) profile page and dashboard.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 19, the Affiliate panel is in the lower right (magenta highlighting).

This will open the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Editing affiliates.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 21, to find out if a person is already your affiliate, look in the table or search for their name in the search box (magenta highlighting).

When you do so, the window will open with detailed information about the person.\n\n\n\nEditing details about an Affiliate’s access.\n\n\nYou have three choices to make:\n\nShould the person have access to other researcher’s data shared on Databrary?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliate access to Databrary\n\n\n\nWith the possible exception of highly trusted, senior graduate students or postdocs, we advise Authorized Investigators not to grant access to all of Databrary to their Affiliates.\nThis is the default.\n\n\n\nShould the person have Read-only, or Read-write access to your lab’s data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManager access\n\n\n\nAs of the 2.0 release, Managers have Read-only access to an Authorized Investigator’s volumes.\nIf you want a person to have Read/write access, select Read-write access.\nWe are evaluating the Manager role and may make minor changes in a forthcoming release.\n\n\nRead-only is the default.\n\nWhen should the authorization expire?\n\nThe default is one year from today’s date. You may choose an earlier date, but not a later one.\nPress the Submit button to authorize the person.\n\n\nEditing an existing affiliate\nThe process for editing an existing Affiliate’s privileges is nearly identical.\n\nFrom your profile page (Figure 19), press the edit (pencil icon; green highlight) in the the Affiliate panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Editing existing Affiliates\n\n\n\n\nFind the Affiliate you wish to edit using the search window (Figure 23, magenta highlight) or by scrolling through the table of currently authorized Affiliates.\nEdit the Affiliate by clicking on the pencil icon (green highlight) or delete the Affiliate by clicking on the trash can icon (cyan highlight).\n\n\n\n\nManaging co-authors on a volume\nUnlike Databrary 1.0, Databrary 2.0 separates the management of co-authors–people who should get scholarly credit for a volume–from people who have access to a Private volume’s data and metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditing co-authors is restricted to a volume’s owner\n\n\n\nIn Databrary 2.0, only the volume owner can edit co-authors.\n\n\n\nVisit a volume that you own.\n\nClick on the edit (pencil) icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Edit button for Volume 1 (owned by Rick Gilmore)\n\n\n\n\nTo edit the order of authors, visit the Overview panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: Edit overview for a volume\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to the Reorder Citation section.
