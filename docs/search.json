    "text": "Managing access to data\n\nManaging affiliates\nAs an Authorized Investigator, you must log in to Databrary and visit your profile page to manage your Affiliates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAuthorized Investigators vs. Affiliates\n\n\n\nRemember that Authorized Investigators differ from Affiliate researchers.\nAuthorized Investigators are authorized by an institution to create volumes on Databrary, download shared data, and give access to data to their staff, students, or postdocs. If a researcher meets the qualifications for getting authorized through their institution, they should secure that authorization.\nAffiliates have access to Databrary only through the sponsorship of an Authorized Investigator.\nNote: Databrary 1.0 permitted some Affiliates to be granted access without a direct sponsorship by a specific Authorized Investigator. Individuals who previously had read/write access to some of your volumes may no longer have that access in Databrary 2.0. To grant these individuals access, you must specifically (re)authorize them as your Affiliate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Screenshot of a user’s (private) profile page and dashboard.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 22, the Affiliate panel is in the lower right (magenta highlighting). Press the edit (pencil icon; green highlighting) button to edit your affiliates.\n\nAuthorizing a new affiliate\nAfter you press the edit button in the previous screen, you will be directed to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Affiliates panel\n\n\n\nClick on Affiliates under the “Current affiliates and requests” section (magenta highlight). This will open the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Editing affiliates.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 24, to find out if a person is already your affiliate, look in the table or search for their name in the search box (magenta highlighting). If the person is not found in the search, press the “Authorize new affiliate” button (green highlighting.)\nA new window will pop-up where you must search for the affiliate’s name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: Finding a new affiliate to authorize.\n\n\n\nMake sure to select the person you want to add. When you do so, the window will open with detailed information about the person.\n\n\n\nEditing details about an Affiliate’s access.\n\n\nYou have three choices to make:\n\nShould the person have access to other researcher’s data shared on Databrary?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningAffiliate access to Databrary\n\n\n\nWith the possible exception of highly trusted, senior graduate students or postdocs, we advise Authorized Investigators not to grant access to all of Databrary to their Affiliates.\nThis is the default.\n\n\n\nShould the person have Read-only, or Read-write access to your lab’s data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningManager access\n\n\n\nAs of the 2.0 release, Managers have Read-only access to an Authorized Investigator’s volumes.\nIf you want a person to have Read/write access, select Read-write access.\nWe are evaluating the Manager role and may make minor changes in a forthcoming release.\n\n\nRead-only is the default.\n\nWhen should the authorization expire?\n\nThe default is one year from today’s date. You may choose an earlier date, but not a later one.\nPress the Submit button to authorize the person.\n\n\nEditing an existing affiliate\nThe process for editing an existing Affiliate’s privileges is nearly identical.\n\nFrom your profile page (Figure 22), press the edit (pencil icon; green highlight) in the the Affiliate panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26: Editing existing Affiliates\n\n\n\n\nFind the Affiliate you wish to edit using the search window (Figure 26, magenta highlight) or by scrolling through the table of currently authorized Affiliates.\nEdit the Affiliate by clicking on the pencil icon (green highlight) or delete the Affiliate by clicking on the trash can icon (cyan highlight).\n\n\n\n\nManaging co-authors on a volume\nUnlike Databrary 1.0, Databrary 2.0 separates the management of co-authors–people who should get scholarly credit for a volume–from people who have access to a Private volume’s data and metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantEditing co-authors is restricted to a volume’s owner\n\n\n\nIn Databrary 2.0, only the volume owner can edit co-authors.\n\n\n\nVisit a volume that you own.\n\nClick on the edit (pencil) icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27: Edit button for Volume 1 (owned by Rick Gilmore)\n\n\n\n\nTo edit the order of authors, visit the Overview panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 28: Edit overview for a volume\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to the Reorder Citation section. Click on the author you wish to reposition to change the author order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29: Citation Preview for Volume 1\n\n\n\nWhen you change the author order, the the window will show you how the author order(s) have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 30: Reordered citation author order\n\n\n\n\nScroll back up to the top of the Overview panel and hit Save to save the change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 31: Save changed author order\n\n\n\nA separate workflow governs modifying the people who should be on the list of authors. To edit a volume’s list of authors, follow these steps:\n\nVisit the Manage Access tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32: Manage volume access\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to the Coauthors section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 33: Coauthors of Volume 1.\n\n\n\n\nTo add a coauthor, press the Add coauthor button (cyan highlight in Figure 33. To delete a coauthor, press on the trash can icon (magenta highlight in Figure 33).\n\n\n\nManaging collaborators on a volume\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantOwners manage collaborators\n\n\n\nIn Databrary 2.0, read or read/write access to a volume is under the control of the volume owner.\nCollaborators can include Authorized Investigators and Affiliates.\n\n\n\nAdding Authorized Investigators\nTo add a colleague who is an Authorized Investigator to a Databrary volume, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the Manage Access panel (see Figure 32) for a volume you own.\n\nScroll to the Collaborators panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 34: Collaborators section in a volume’s Manage Access panel\n\n\n\n\nSearch for a collaborator’s name by pressing on the sort arrow below the Full Name column. A search/filter window will appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 35: Search for a collaborator by name.\n\n\n\n\nIf the person is already a collaborator on the volume, their name and information will appear in the list. Edit their information by pressing on the pencil icon (magenta highlight) or delete the collaborator by pressing on the trash can icon (cyan highlight).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 36: Editing an existing collaborator\n\n\n\n\nIf a person is not yet a collaborator on the volume, their name will not appear on the list. Press the Add collaborator button to add them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 37: Adding a new collaborator\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Add new collaborator window appears, search for the person you wish to add by typing part of their name in the Select user field. If more than one user matches the search, select the correct user and press the SUBMIT button at lower right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 38: Searching for and adding a new collaborator\n\n\n\nAfter you select the user, the Add New collaborator panel will show more complete information about the person. Select the person’s Access Level to the volume (Read only, Investigator [read/write]; magenta box), the date their access expires (1 year or less from today’s date; cyan box), and whether their access to your volume should be visible to other collaborators (green box).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 39: Adding a new collaborator and selecting parameters related to their access.\n\n\n\n\nPress the SUBMIT button (orange box) to save the changes.",

Databrary calls these people Authorized Investigators and Affiliates. Authorized Investigators may request access to restricted data and may share data with Affiliates and other Authorized Investigators, and sometimes with the general public. Affiliates may request access to restricted data through an Authorized Investigators but may not share data with other users.\nAll parties, even members of the public, are responsible for the appropriate use of Databrary and the materials stored there. Responsibilities that apply to everyone are set out in the Databrary Terms and Conditions of Use. For Authorized Investigators and Affiliates, there are additional responsibilities. Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must ensure that their use of Databrary complies with the terms of the agreement their institution has signed to permit access to Databrary.\nOne of the first things a new Databrary user must determine is what status they can have, Authorized Investigator or Affiliate. Authorized Investigators have more privileges and responsibilities because of their more permanent and official status with an institution that grants a person authorization through the Databrary Access Agreement.

It may be adapted to suit the specific purposes of the researcher and requirements of the institution. Researchers should confirm institution/agency/directorate/program-specific application requirements before submission.\nPlease contact us at contact@databrary.org for further assistance.\n\nSecondary Reuse\nThis project will conduct secondary analyses of participant data obtained from Databrary, an online platform for the storage, sharing, and re-use of video and other research data. Participants’ consent for study participation and release of data to Databrary were obtained by the original researcher under the oversight of their institutional review board. Because there is no direct contact with participants as a part of this project, the level of additional risk to participants is low.\n\n\nPrimary data collection\nData will be handled by the team of researchers approved on the IRB protocols of all Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators. Data are linked to participants by subject ID. However, video data are potentially identifiable because participants’ faces are visible and their names may be heard. With participant consent, study data will be stored on Databrary, a secure web-based video library housed at NYU, allowing permission-based access to coders from all labs comprising the project team. At the end of each lab visit, caregivers will be asked whether they are comfortable: 1) storing their videos and children’s birthdates and other metadata on Databrary, and 2) sharing their data with authorized researchers outside of this protocol who are members of the academic research and clinical communities authorized to access Databrary. If caregivers agree to video sharing, the videos will be made available to authorized researchers as outlined below. If caregivers do not agree, their videos will be accessible only by researchers on the project protocol and not shared with the larger community. The policies for sharing videos and other potentially identifiable data on Databrary have been carefully developed and monitored with the advice of the legal counsel, grants/contracts office, and IRBs of both New York University and The Pennsylvania State University. Currently, more than 780 institutions in the U.S. and around the world have formally approved the Databrary Access Agreement to enable video sharing and reuse. Parents also will be told that they can share portions of data or ask for particular sessions not to be shared while sharing other sessions.\n\n\nPolicies for Databrary access and data sharing\nSensitive or identifiable data shared with Databrary will only be viewable to and downloadable by authorized users who have been granted secure access by Databrary’s administrators. Select data may be made available to the public, but only as determined by the researcher and on the basis of participant permission. Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, and researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators and under their supervision, are authorized for access.\nAuthorized users are required to sign a user access agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories.\nOnly videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording are made available to the community of authorized Databrary users. In consultation with ethics board officials at New York University and the Pennsylvania State University, Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data.\nFederal policies do not require re-consenting of minor participants when they reach the age of majority, if re-consenting is impractical or otherwise increases risks to participants (e.g., by requiring researchers to maintain links between identifiable information and collected data for extended time periods).\n\n\nPolicies and provisions for reuse and redistribution\nAccess to videos and metadata will be available for educational and research purposes, subject to participant consent. Such access will be provided using the Databrary web-based application. Materials generated under the project will be disseminated in accordance with the policies of [GRANT-GIVING ORGANIZATION] and participating institutions. Publication of data shall occur during the project, if appropriate, or at the end of the project, consistent with normal scientific practices.\n\n\nArchiving and preservation of research data\nData in Databrary will be preserved indefinitely in a secure data storage facility at New York University (NYU); the facility is managed by the university’s Information Technology Services department. Central IT staff handle storage, network, and backup systems. NYU does routine tape backups that are stored off site and performs regular file fixity checks to monitor the integrity of stored assets. Federal regulations do not require that data be destroyed after a particular time period if they are stored indefinitely in a recognized repository.\n\n\nData Security\nData and metadata stored in Databrary are subject to the security policies and best practices implemented by NYU.

This document is intended to help researchers who plan to store and share video data in Databrary prepare grant materials for submission. The material here is particularly suited to NSF application requirements, but similar language can be adapted for NIH grants as well as private foundations. Please contact us at contact@databrary.org for further assistance.\nResearchers should confirm institution/agency/directorate/program-specific resource sharing plan or data management plan requirements.\n\n\nData Formats\nDatabrary transcodes all deposited video data into standard and HTML5-compatible formats, currently H.264+AAC as MP4. It stores the original video file along with the transformed, web accessible video file. Databrary stores other data in their original formats (e.g., .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .csv, .pdf, .jpg, .png). As standards for preferred video file formats change over time, Databrary will perform file format migrations to those preferred formats.\n\n\nMetadata\nDatabrary takes and stores metadata related to a full dataset (e.g., title, authors, related publication, description of study, keywords or tags, associated URLs), individual study sessions (e.g. metadata related to participants, study groups and conditions, location, language, and session date and tasks), and video files (e.g., title, duration, tags) related to a dataset. Metadata is added through a user-friendly web interface where auto-completion, suggested terms, and integration with third party services (e.g., CrossRef) guide users through its creation. Metadata may be accessed through the web interface, via API, or downloaded as a comma separated values (CSV) file.\n\n\nDocumentation\nData owners can upload and store on Databrary any number of related documents that assist other researchers in understanding their data (e.g. study protocol, coding manuals, output from video coding software, and procedural videos). These documents can be associated with the dataset as a whole, or with individual sessions within the dataset.\n\n\nPolicies for access and sharing\nData will be stored with, and shared through, Databrary. Researchers are asked to avoid the inclusion of extraneous personally identifiable information (PII) in videos uploaded to Databrary. However, given the nature of video, it might still be possible to identify individuals based on first names, facial features, or details of the environment. Because of this, sensitive or identifiable data shared with Databrary will only be viewable and downloadable to authorized users who have been granted secure access by Databrary’s administrators. Select data may be made available to the public, but only as determined by the researcher and on the basis of participant permission. Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, or researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators, will be authorized for access.\nAuthorized users will be required to sign a user agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories.\nAlthough Databrary will store complete study data, only videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording will be made available to the community of authorized users. Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data.\nData owners can choose to share their data at any point, either as they collect their data, or only once data collection has completed.\n\n\nPolicies and provisions for reuse and redistribution\nAccess to videos and metadata will be available for educational and research purposes, subject to participant consent.

Databrary’s mission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and related data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral, educational, and neural sciences.\nThe responsibility for protecting research data and research participants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates, Institutions, and Databrary.\nDatabrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video and related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is restricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by their Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of Authorized Investigators through a research ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S. Government. Authorized Investigators who share data with others must secure permission to share from research participants and record that permission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized Investigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other Authorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles, including respect for the sharing permissions granted by research participants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights of research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data.",

    "text": "The Databrary Access Agreement permits data use and data contribution\nDatabrary restricts access to Authorized Investigators whose Institutions sign a formal Databrary Access Agreement.\nThe Databrary Access Agreement combines provisions for data use and data contribution. Unlike data use agreements that allow specific individuals access to a particular dataset for a discrete research purpose, the Databrary Access Agreement allows any Authorized Investigator to access all shared datasets on Databrary and use the datasets for many different Institutionally-approved purposes. In addition, the Databrary Access Agreement permits Authorized Investigators to upload data and to share it with other Authorized Investigators in accord with the sharing permissions granted by participants and any required Institutional approvals. Databrary believes that combining data use and data contribution in a single agreement reduces barriers to data sharing, meets emerging funder mandates to share research data, and accelerates progress in research.",

GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the European Economic Area (EEA).\nDatabrary’s servers are currently located in the United States, and data stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and re-used by Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the EEA. There are more than 500 Institutions across the globe that have signed the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of Authorized Investigators who have access to shared research data at this link.\nIn seeking permission to collect data from research participants governed by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants information about who may have access to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored. Institutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that satisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of GDPR.\nDatabrary does not typically store information that links a person’s identity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between the Authorized Investigator, the Institution, and Databrary to store this type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy of data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal data that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or Institution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary. Also, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other Authorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who accessed a participant’s personal data prior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants that there are limits to a participant’s right to modify or delete personal data that have already been shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains language for this purpose.\nWhen accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators, Institutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have given in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR provisions.",

Children came from diverse backgrounds (African-American, Dominican, Mexican, Chinese) and lived in the New York City metro area. Videos were recorded during various activities and tasks specific to each observation age (e.g., book reading, mother-child free play, novel toy, familiar toy at the 14-month visit) in children’s homes or in the laboratory at 14, 24, 36, 52, 64, and 76 months of age.”\nLEGO: The project includes a corpus of 234 hours of video recording (across 2 days, 2 hours per visit) of infants and mothers going about their daily routines. We video coded foundational passes on infant object play, motor play, and language behaviours, thereby producing rich descriptive data on how infants play, how play changes across the course of a day and the second year, and which environmental and social factors support infant play. This project yields several valuable products that are disseminated to and shared with the scientific community, parents, and other stakeholders.",

    "text": "I qualify as an Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR). Can I sign as both Authorized Investigator and AOR?\nNo. If you qualify as an Authorized Organizational Representative you will need to have the staff member above you on an organizational chart sign for you.\n\n\nCan individuals not associated with an institution be authorized?\nNo. To become an Authorized Investigator on Databrary you/your institution must meet All of the following conditions:\n\nHave PI status or you are eligible to conduct independent research at this Institution and the Institution accepts responsibility for its Authorized Investigators’ actions related to the use of Databrary\n\nHave all current research ethics training that addresses human subjects policy and issues required by your institution; and\n\nYour institution must maintain an ethics or Institutional Review Board with U.S.-equivalent standards that reviews and approves research involving human subjects,\n\nBe part of an institution that grants you the authority to choose and manage affiliates who meet Databrary’s qualifications and who agree to follow Databrary’s ethical principles, and\n\nThe person executing this Access Agreement on behalf of the Institution has the authority to do so\n\nData on Databrary is provided for non-commercial and non-personal use only and is subject to the terms of use outlined in the Databrary Access Agreement.\n\n\n\nHow much does Databrary cost?\nFor the time being, there is no cost to use Databrary.\nHowever, consistent with the practices of peer data repositories and data services (ICSPR, Data Dryad, FigShare) we are developing a fee-for-service and subscription model that we will implement in late 2025. We encourage researchers with large datasets who are writing funding proposals to contact us in advance so that suitable data curation and storage fees can be included in the grant budget.\n\n\nHow is Databrary funded?\nDatabrary is supported through grants from federal agencies, and private foundations.\n\n\nWhere is Databrary located?\nDatabrary is located at New York University (NYU). All data is stored on servers that are maintained by NYU IT staff.\n\n\nI did all registration and authorization steps on Databrary. I need to download a data set. My supervising professor has registered and gave me access but I still can’t download it.\nYour supervising professor did register and requested access to Databrary. Access is not immediate. Your supervising professor and an authorized signatory on behalf of the university must review and approve the agreement. After Databrary receives the completed agreement, we may grant Databrary authorization to your supervising professor. The time it takes for this to be completed depends on the internal requirements of each institution.\n\n\nDoes Databrary offer “blind review”?\nDatabrary is a restricted access data repository that promotes the storage and sharing of identifiable and sensitive data. As such, Databrary has unique policies to protect the privacy of research participants. These policies govern who can access identifiable data and under what circumstances. The policies are codified in a formal access agreement that binds NYU, Databrary’s parent institution, and similar institutions where Databrary’s users conduct research. For the forseeable future, these policies make it impossible to support full double-blinded anonymous review of data and materials.\nWhile some data and materials are shared with the public, Databrary restricts access to sensitive and identifiable information to people who have received authorization from an institution or to those whose access is supervised by an authorized investigator. Only authorized investigators can create and share datasets. Dataset creators, not Databrary, determine what level of sharing is appropriate for individual data files and for datasets as a whole.\nSo, the level of access a reviewer can have to a dataset depends on two things: Has the dataset been shared with the Databrary community? Does the reviewer have authorization from an institution to view restricted data or materials?\nIf both answers are yes, the reviewer may fully vet a shared dataset. Databrary does not report on access to specific datasets, so the reviewer can remain anonymous. Databrary does not mask the identities of dataset owners, so the blinding is only one-way.\nIf the dataset is shared, but the reviewer does not have authorization from an institution, the reviewer can confirm that a shared dataset exists, that the dataset has a persistent identifier, and that the dataset has a specific number of shared restricted access files. The reviewer may also examine any items that are shared with the public, stimuli, protocol, aggregated and de-identified datasets, etc.\n\n\nWhat if an authorized investigator is leaving their institution for another institution but should still retain authorized investigator status?\nThe authorized investigator would need to meet all criteria required for authorization at both institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I fix an audio file that is not playing in Databrary?\n\nDownload original session from Databrary and unzip the file\nOpen the free audio editing program Audacity\nOpen the file.\nSelect the downloaded file from the appropriate folder, usually the ownloads folder\n\n\n\n\nAn audio file opened in Audacity\n\n\n\nGo to File &gt; export &gt; export as MP3\nUse the following default parameters\n\n\n\n\nFile export window in audacity\n\n\n\nIf your file is named incorrectly (e.g. spaces/brackets/filename truncated) please edit the filename here.\n\n\nA window pops up called ‘edit metadata tags’. just select OK\nThis new file needs to be replaced in the Databrary session folder.\n\n\n\nHow do I fix a video file that is not streaming in the Databrary application?\nIf you ever find that there are videos that don’t play in Databrary, the following instructions may be helpful to you.\n\nuse Handbrake (https://handbrake.fr/) to convert/transcode these files to .mp4 (this will change and fix the file if there is any corrupted block)\nGo back to the session\nhighlight the video\nclick on the pencil in the upper left corner to edit\nclick on ‘replace’ in the upper right corner\n\nThe recommended settings in Handbrake that duplicate the .mp4 codec that Databrary uses during the transcoding process after a video file is uploaded are below. These settings may also be downloaded as a .json file and imported into Handbrake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nDimensions\nFilters\nVideo\nAudio\n\n\n\n\nFormat = MP4\nCropping = None\nDeinterlace = Decomb\nVideo Encoder = H.264 (x264)\nCodec = AAC (CoreAudio)\n\n\nSelect “passthru” metadata\nResolution Limit = 1080p HD\n\nFramerate (FPS) = Same as source\nMixdown = 2ch Stereo audio (force to 2ch mixdown)\n\n\nAlign A/V Start\nAnamorphic = Automatic\n\nVariable Framerate\n\n\n\nH.264 (x264) VFR video\nSelect ‘Optimal Size’\n\nQuality = Constant Quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOops, I uploaded the wrong file in my session. Can I replace it?\nYes! Please follow these instructions:\n\nLogin to Databrary\nClick on ‘Your Profile’ in the center of the screen\nNavigate to the appropriate volume\nThen the appropriate session\nSingle Click on the file that needs to be replaced.\nClick on the Edit Button (the small pencil)\nEnsure the appropriate file is highlighted in gray.\nClick ‘Replace File’ at the top right of the screen\nNavigate in the files pane to the correct file then select Open\n\n\n\nI just uploaded a video file onto Databrary and it says my uploading is complete. Why can’t I see it on or download it from Databrary right away?\nWhen you upload a video or audio file, Databrary converts it (transcodes it) into a common format that should be accessible well into the future. The original file format is stored in parallel. Transcoding videos takes time. Databrary will not show a thumbnail of your file until the transcoding finishes. If your file is especially large, then the wait time could be several hours.\nIf your file takes longer than that, contact Databrary support. Sometimes, transcoding jobs fail, and we can fix the problem at our end.\n\n\nI downloaded files from Databrary, but the filenames are truncated.\nWhen you download files from the Databrary application, the system appends information about the volume and session the files came from. This is to help you understand what you’ve downloaded. However, when Databrary downloads files there is a 32 character limit to the file name. So, if your file on Databrary has a long name, some of that name may be truncated in the downloaded file. Or, if the file name is too long (the first 32 characters of the filename are exactly the same as another file), it is impossible to distinguish between these files when they download and only one file will be downloaded.\nThere are two solutions:\n\nTry not to create excessively long file names for files stored on Databrary.\nAlternatively, you may want to download and use the databraryr R package. The package includes commands to download files from Databrary with the original (full length) Databrary file names intact. See this section of the databraryr guide for more information.\n\n\n\nI have a dataset that has been completely collected. Now we are ready to share with Databrary. What do I do?\nSend an Email to Databrary so they may assist you. You will need to include answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat is the name and email address for PI for this project?\n\nDo you have permission to share these data with the Databrary community?\n\nWas a Data Sharing Release or something similar completed at the time of Data Collection?\n\nDo you have permission from your IRB or Research Ethics Board used at your institution to share these data with Databrary?\n\n\nHow many files are there for this dataset?\n\nWhat file types do you have (e.g. .mov, .mp4, .mp3, .pdf, .xls)? Databrary Supported File Formats\nWhat is the total size of dataset (X GB)?\n\nHow many different sessions/participants do you have?\n\nDo you have materials to share (e.g. data collection instructions, survey questions) in addition to the videos collected for the study?\n\nDiscuss this project with the Databrary Team to determine the next steps.\n\nFormat your data with the same file structure for all sessions/participants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ninsert picture examples\n\n\n\nShare data folder with the  Databrary Support Specialist  on Box.\nCreate list of files using Terminal (how to find terminal on Windows and Mac)\n\nfind [path to folder with files] &gt; out.txt\nE.g. find /Users/username/Box/Data_for_Databrary &gt; out.txt\n\nDownload ingest_template.xls by opening the link, then click on the filename and select download.\n\nDetails for what needs to be completed on these templates are found here\n\nMake sure the items in the required columns are completed for each file.\n\nthe table Session Metadata describes the fields in the sessions_template.csv\n\nthe table Participant Metadata describes the fields in the participants_template.csv\n\n\nThe participantID on the sessions_template and participants_template must match\n\nkey is typically the same as participantID\n\n\nIt may be easier to complete ingest_template.xlsx then save each tab as a .csv\n\nparticipants_template.csv\n\nsessions_template.csv\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a multi-site study. Is there a recommendation on volume/file naming schemes?\nTry naming the each Volume: ProjectName_SITEID\nThe Short Name is INTERNAL only to volume Investigators and Collaborators\nWhere each SITEID has a unique id to each site, typically with the same number of characters.\nEach file uploaded can have a standard naming scheme which includes the SITEID.\nIn the Volume Description, list the name of the university/institution in full. This allows for use of an API pull to ingest data when necessary.\nAfter all data are collected, a new volume with ALL of the final data, including which data are from which site, can be created.\n\n\nIs there a storage capacity limit for each project?\nAt the moment, no.\nWhen we implement our fee-for-service/subscription model later in 2024, we will likely impose project-, researcher-, and institution- level limits for new projects that do not pay or subscribe.\n\n\nIs there a maximum file size? We have some multigig videos and want to check ahead of time if there is a limit\nAt the moment, no.\nHowever, we do not guarantee that large videos will transcode or stream well.\nIf you need to download videos en masse or large videos, please consider using the databraryr package. It can be much faster than the web application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe are still drafting responses to the following questions:\n\nI have a multisite study. How do I add my co-investigators in the right order to the Databrary volume?\n\n\nI am an authorized investigator. What is the best practice for revoking access to affiliates who originally were in my lab but have left?\n\n\nRegarding permissions for users. We anticipate that we will have a range of users including faculty, professional developers, graduate students. We think getting access will be pretty straightforward for individuals connected to a university. However, how would someone (e.g., professional developer in a school district) gain access?\n\n\nIs there a maximum file size? We have some multigig videos and want to check ahead of time if there is a limit",

Right now, the application returns a placeholder image and the user cannot\n\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet\n\n(discuss): (What features of the existing session/slot spreadsheet interface for managing and visualizing demographic data can be implemented easily and at minimal cost using existing libraries?\n\nSee also below section on support for schemas.\n\n\nSecurity\n\nCan two-factor authentication be added? If so, at what cost?3\n\n\n\nAdmin/Superuser\n\n(discuss): Can per-institution (across users and projects), per-user (across projects) or per-project storage quotas be implemented? Can warnings be generated when storage amounts are nearing quotas? How could Super Users manage user requests to increase quotas?\n(discuss): Can a more informative administrative console be developed with by-volume, usage, and storage metrics, including shared vs. unshared data? If so, at what cost?\n\nSee also section below about other administrative upgrades. This will probably get pushed to later.\n\n\nAccess to volumes\n\n(discuss): Volume access expires after a user-defined date that is no longer than one year from the date of the last update.\n\n\n\n\nRoadmap (&gt;2.0)\nThese ideas are on the longer-term roadmap. Some of them may be supported by proposals under review (e.g., HNDS-I or NYU TAC).\n\nSupport for open data schemas\n\nJSON-LD\n\nDatabrary should eventually support standard schemas wherever practical, specifically in the JSON-LD format. These should use Schema.org properties.\nExamples of properties that seem relevant to Databrary include:\n\nPerson\nCreative Work\n\nVideoObject\n\nEvent\n\nFor a data collection session or change in status on the site.\n\nPlace\n\nTesting locations, geographical information, locations of institutions\n\nData Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese examples are not exhaustive.\n\n\n\nBy support, I mean that the application should add relevant schema information to the JSON data provided by the API.\n\n\n\nNIH CDE\n\nDatabrary should also support NIH Common Data Elements (CDEs), especially for “spreadsheet” data elements.\nExamples of CDE properties of a Person\n\nGender: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/formView?tinyId=vx35JcbgJI\nSex at Birth: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=rGEh0ckdmr\nRace: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=Fakc6Jy2x\nRace/Ethnicity Self-Identification: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=LakF0YkywC\nEthnicity: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=PtRlg7yLP_\nDisabilities: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=0md12WGtZXE\nBirth date: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=X1mJv5j3jx.\nList of languages: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=7JDyF9o3ie\n\nLanguage secondary text: https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=mJsWHcxje9W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are a set of CDEs that NIH endorses.

Would doing so make it easier to search and filter data by these characteristics?\n(discuss): Should the database schema support linking data about the same individuals? This would require supporting something like the NIMH GUID, and possibly some additional data sharing consent language that permits data linkage.\n(discuss): Should species and other terms commonly used in non-human animal research be incorporated and supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt does not appear that there are NIH-Endorsed elements that contain the term “species”.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved search and filtering\nIdeas from HNDS-I 2024 proposal:\n\nBroader set of demographic characteristics.\nIndex other text documents (protocols, coding manuals) in materials folders.\n\n\nIndex annotation files, return segments\n\n“Building on this foundation, we will upgrade Databrary to support searching within annotation files linked to videos that tag specific behaviors, utterances, or contexts, starting with the most popular annotation file formats stored on Databrary (Datavyu and CHAT)”\n\n— HNDS-I proposal.\n\n\n\n“Virtual volumes” or custom collections\n\nTo capitalize on enhanced search and filtering and ease data reuse, users must be able to create their own custom collections of video files, video segments, annotations, and other data derived from multiple, primary datasets. The custom collections or “virtual datasets” will link to but not copy parent datasets and their associated metadata.\n\n— HNDS-I proposal.\n\n\nWorkspaces\n\n…We will implement private, flexible, temporary workspaces for datasets that act like folders in cloud storage. Unlike other forms of cloud storage that provide only a temporary home for research data, Databrary’s workspaces will provide a permanent and flexible home that is just a button press away from being made accessible to the broader research community.\n\n– HNDS-I proposal.\n\n\nExpanding scriptable access\n\n…We will build on the free, open-source, R package, databraryr, that PI Gilmore developed with NSF support and openly released to the research community. Databraryr wraps Databrary API calls into commands that are useful to researchers who want to download shared data from Databrary. We will add data uploading capabilities to the R package to support Aim 3, develop and publish a parallel Python package, databrarypy.\n\n– HNDS-I proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nHow do we permit scriptable access while protecting Databrary from unwanted “bot” access?\nSome users find that the web interface times out when they try to download large numbers or large files.\n\n\n\n\nMore flexible downloading\nWhen users select sessions with large numbers or large files, the application creates a zip file. Generating that file consumes central app resources (compute and memory) and can cause long pauses in a user’s experience with the app.\nA better solution would be to create the archive offline and notify the user when it is ready to download.\n\n\nAdministrative panel upgrades\n\nQuotas on per-user, per-institution storage footprints.\nInfrastructure for managing subscriptions, curation assistance, data deposit fees.\nLinks to institutional admin panel functions; data footprint, etc.\n\n\n\nVersion control\nZenodo and OSF implement this.\n\n\nPrivate volumes for peer review\nOSF implements this.\n\n\nSupport for institutional subscriptions\nThese features are described in a proposal submitted to NYU TAC in August 2024.",

Authorized Investigators approved by their Institutions for access to Databrary may access data shared by others and/or contribute data for others to access. Databrary requires that an Authorized Investigator secure Institutional approval, usually from a research ethics board, before contributing personally identifiable human or non-human animal data to Databrary or conducting research on any data obtained from others through Databrary. Databrary, however, does not require Institutional approval for permitted non-research uses (e.g., pre-research, preliminary analysis, self-study, teaching) beyond this Databrary Access Agreement.\nAll Institutions and Authorized Investigators agree to use Databrary and data obtained through it exclusively for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research or education.\nBy signing this Databrary Access Agreement, the Institution verifies that (a) it maintains or uses an ethics board or Institutional Review Board with U.S.-equivalent standards that reviews and approves research involving human subjects, (b) it reviews and approves research involving non-human animal subjects, (c) its Authorized Investigators have training that addresses research ethics with human subjects and/or non-human animals, (d) its Authorized Investigators are eligible to conduct independent research at the Institution, (e) its use of Databrary will comply with this Databrary Access Agreement, and it accepts responsibility for its Authorized Investigators’ and other employees’ actions related to the use of Databrary, (f) it grants Authorized Investigators the authority to choose and manage affiliates, and (g) the person executing this Databrary Access Agreement on behalf of the Institution has the authority to do so.\nThe Institution and the Authorized Investigators agree that Databrary, New York University, The Pennsylvania State University, and the relevant funding agencies bear no responsibility for the use of Databrary or the information contained within it. Except in cases where the Institution is expressly prohibited by law from indemnifying third parties, the Institution indemnifies and renders harmless Databrary, New York University, and The Pennsylvania State University from all claims, losses, liability, and other damages that arise from violations of this Access Agreement by the Institution or the Institution’s Authorized Investigators. In cases where the Institution is prohibited by law from indemnifying third parties, in accordance with and to the extent permitted and limited by a superseding national, state, or local provision, statute, or law, the Institution agrees that it will be responsible for the payment of claims, including for loss, personal injury, death, property damage, or otherwise, arising out of any act or omission of its employees or agents in connection with the performance of this agreement for which it is held liable under applicable law. It is understood and agreed that this document shall constitute a separate agreement between Databrary and the Institution, as amended from time to time by the Institution and Databrary, to include additional Authorized Investigators as listed in Annex II, to include new datasets available to Authorized Investigators, and to expand the uses allowed for shared datasets.\nBy signing this Databrary Access Agreement, effective as of the date entered below, the Institution and its Authorized Investigators (optionally listed under Annex II) hereby agree to its terms, including those found in the attached Annex I (“Statement of Rights and Responsibilities”), and in the attached Annex III (“Databrary Access Guide”). The Databrary Access Guide may be amended from time to time. Databrary will notify the Institution and its Authorized Investigators of any amendments to the Databrary Access Guide by email and will maintain a copy on the Databrary website.",

    "section": "Annex III – Databrary Access Guide",
    "text": "Annex III – Databrary Access Guide\nVersion date: April 29, 2020\nThis Databrary Access Guide provides information useful for Institutions and Authorized Investigators who wish to use Databrary’s services.\n\nFor Institutions\nDatabrary is a restricted access data library specialized for storing, streaming, and sharing of video and audio recordings. Databrary’s mission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and related data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral, educational, and neural sciences.\nThe responsibility for protecting research data and research participants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates, Institutions, and Databrary.\nDatabrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video and related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is restricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by their Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of Authorized Investigators through a research ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S. Government (see: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html). Authorized Investigators who share data with others must secure permission to share from research participants and record that permission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized Investigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other Authorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles, including respect for the sharing permissions granted by research participants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights of research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data.\n\nThe Databrary Access Agreement permits data use and data contribution\nDatabrary restricts access to Authorized Investigators whose Institutions sign a formal Databrary Access Agreement.\nThe Databrary Access Agreement combines provisions for data use and data contribution. Unlike data use agreements that allow specific individuals access to a particular dataset for a discrete research purpose, the Databrary Access Agreement allows any Authorized Investigator to access all shared datasets on Databrary and use the datasets for many different Institutionally-approved purposes. In addition, the Databrary Access Agreement permits Authorized Investigators to upload data and to share it with other Authorized Investigators in accord with the sharing permissions granted by participants and any required Institutional approvals. Databrary believes that combining data use and data contribution in a single agreement reduces barriers to data sharing, meets emerging funder mandates to share research data, and accelerates progress in research.\n\n\nVideo’s use cases extend beyond research\nIn addition to its many uses in research, video may be used for a variety of pre-research and non-research uses, such as the documentation of methodological details, the demonstration of computer-based tasks, or the showing of video clips for teaching or scientific presentations. Databrary encourages the storage and sharing of video for all of these purposes, in a manner consistent with subject permissions and institutional approvals.\n\n\nInstitutions determine when research ethics board or IRB approval is necessary\nDatabrary does not require prior research ethics board or IRB approval for an Authorized Investigator to be granted access to the system or to use Databrary’s shared resources for non-research, educational, or pre-research uses. However, in signing the Databrary Access Agreement, all Authorized Investigators promise to secure research ethics approval whenever their use of Databrary requires it under the Institution’s policies.\nNon-research, educational, or pre-research use cases may not require research ethics board or IRB review and approval at every institution. Institutions decide which use cases require research ethics board or IRB review and approval.\n\n\nWhat data are shared\nDatabrary contains images, video, and audio recordings that may be identifiable, data and metadata that are not typically sensitive, and de-identified data. Exact birth dates may be stored for use in calculating exact ages, but exact birth dates are only exposed to Authorized Investigators or Affiliates given specific access to data. Names, addresses, email addresses, financial information, government ID numbers, detailed geographic location information, and other personally identifiable data elements are not stored and shared on Databrary.\n\n\nSecuring permission to share\nIn order to contribute and share identifiable data with Databrary, Authorized Investigators must secure permission to store the recordings on Databrary from research participants and any other people (e.g., research staff) who are recorded.\nDatabrary has developed a Sharing Release Template that informs people depicted in recordings of the potential risks associated with sharing video and other data on Databrary. The Sharing Release Template is one of the resources that Databrary has made available to researchers. The Sharing Release Template may be adapted for use at any Institution and added to any research ethics or IRB protocol. However, an Institution may require other release language in order to provide equivalent protections.\nWhether de-identified or pseudonymized data may be shared with Databrary without seeking explicit permission from research participants depends on the Authorized Investigator’s Institution. Some ethics boards or IRBs may allow de-identified or pseudonymized data to be shared without the explicit permission of the research participant.\n\n\nUploading data and assigning sharing permission levels\nAuthorized Investigators who upload data to Databrary must assign to each file uploaded the level of data sharing granted by research participants—from none to public access. The sharing level assigned to each file by default is Private, meaning that no person other than the Authorized Investigator who uploaded the file and any Affiliates granted access by the Authorized Investigator, may view the file.\nNot only are data files assigned a Private sharing level by default, but all newly created datasets are initially made Private, accessible only to an Authorized Investigator, any Affiliates the Authorized Investigator selects, and any other individual Authorized Investigators granted specific access to the dataset. An Authorized Investigator may elect to create an overview of a dataset when it is created and make the overview publicly available. The overview can serve as the public face of the dataset while the dataset is being collected and analyzed. This can be useful in documenting progress on a research grant to sponsors. The dataset overview does not expose data unless the Authorized Investigator chooses to do so.\n\n\nSharing data\nAt a time when the Authorized Investigator chooses—e.g., when a paper goes to press or a grant period ends—the Authorized Investigator may choose to share the dataset with other Authorized Investigators on Databrary. This makes the data contained in the dataset available to other Authorized Investigators and possibly the public, but only in accordance with the sharing levels selected by Authorized Investigators and always subject to the permission granted by participants. That is, individual data files marked Private remain accessible only to people the Authorized Investigator specifically selects. Similarly, access to datasets labeled Private remains solely under the control of the Authorized Investigator.\n\n\nDatabrary and GDPR\nAuthorized Investigators may collect personal data from research participants who have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the European Economic Area (EEA).\nDatabrary’s servers are currently located in the United States, and data stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and re-used by Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the EEA. There are more than 500 Institutions across the globe that have signed the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of Authorized Investigators who have access to shared research data at https://nyu.databrary.org/search?volume=false&f.party_authorization=4&f.party_is_institution=false.\nIn seeking permission to collect data from research participants governed by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants information about who may have access to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored. Institutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that satisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of GDPR.\nDatabrary does not typically store information that links a person’s identity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between the Authorized Investigator, the Institution, and Databrary to store this type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy of data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal data that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or Institution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary. Also, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other Authorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who accessed a participant’s personal data prior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants that there are limits to a participant’s right to modify or delete personal data that have already been shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains language for this purpose.\nWhen accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators, Institutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have given in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR provisions.\n\n\nWhen Authorized Investigators leave an Institution\nAuthorized Investigators are expected to inform Databrary when they leave an Institution. Institutions may also inform Databrary.\nAccess to non-public data shared with other Authorized Investigators will be suspended when an Authorized Investigator leaves an Institution. The suspension extends to an Authorized Investigators’ Affiliates. Authorized Investigators will continue to have password-protected access to data they uploaded to Databrary once they leave an Institution. When a new Institution grants authorization, Authorized Investigators will regain access to non-public data shared by other Authorized Investigators.\nIf an Authorized Investigator retires, is incapacitated due to illness, or dies, the Institution should inform Databrary so that the Authorized Investigator’s account may be suspended. An Institution may choose to designate a data steward for the Authorized Investigator’s data and authorize that person to manage access to the data. If the Institution does not identify and authorize a data steward, Databrary staff will serve that role. However, the Databrary staff serving as data steward will not change the data sharing status of any specific dataset without explicit written guidance from the Institution.\n\n\nSelecting Affiliates\nIf permitted by their Institution, an Authorized Investigator may grant a person outside their Institution Affiliate status. Institutions may establish policies governing the selection and management of Affiliates by their Authorized Investigators.\nIf a person is eligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home Institution, that person must apply for access to Databrary through their home Institution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers eligible to be Authorized Investigators at their home Institution should not be granted access to Databrary as the Affiliate of another Authorized Investigator either from the same Institution or a different one. Databrary welcomes questions about these policies. Please email contact@databrary.org.\n\n\n\nFor Researchers\nThis section explains how to apply for authorization, select and manage affiliates, collect data that can be shared, upload and manage datasets and studies, and explore, re-use, and extend the resources shared with Databrary.\n\nGetting Authorized\nSome materials on Databrary are available to the public, but access to most data requires that a person secure formal written authorization from an Institution. The Databrary Access Agreement is the legally binding document that formalizes the authorization process.\nIndividuals who are eligible to conduct independent research, submit funding proposals as the lead investigator, have Principal Investigator (PI) status, or have tenure-track faculty positions at their Institution, may apply to their Institution for approval to be named an Authorized Investigator. To receive authorization a person must apply for and receive authorization from their Institution; Databrary does not grant authorization separate from an Institution. In the U.S., a college or university’s grants and contracts or sponsored programs office usually takes responsibility for granting authorization by signing the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary staff will work with a researcher and an Institution to secure signatures on the Databrary Access Agreement. The authorization process typically takes a few days to a few weeks.\n\n\nSelecting and managing Affiliates\nOnce authorized by their Institution, Authorized Investigators may then authorize staff, undergraduate or graduate students, or postdoctoral trainees to access Databrary as Affiliates. In granting a person Affiliate status, an Authorized Investigator takes responsibility for that person’s use of Databrary.\nAn Authorized Investigator may grant a person outside their Institution Affiliate status if permitted by their Institution. If a person is eligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home Institution, that person should apply for access to Databrary through their home Institution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers eligible to be Authorized Investigators should not be granted access to Databrary as the Affiliate of another Authorized Investigator.\nAuthorized Investigators are responsible for ensuring that Affiliates have human subjects and/or animal research training appropriate for the Institution and remain in good standing with the Institution.\n\n\nAffiliate access to an Authorized Investigator’s data\nAuthorized Investigators determine which of the Authorized Investigator’s datasets an Affiliate has access to. Authorized Investigators can set each Affiliate’s access to one of the following levels:\n\nNo access: Affiliate cannot access any of the Authorized Investigator’s data. This is the default.\nRead-only access: Affiliate has view access to all of the Authorized Investigator’s data. (The affiliate may view and download videos and other identifying information, including data that is not released for sharing.)\nRead/Write Access: Affiliate can access and edit all of the Authorized Investigator’s data. (The affiliate may view, download, add, change, and remove data as the Authorized Investigator without restriction.)\nManager: Affiliate can access and change permissions on all of the Authorized Investigator’s data. (The Affiliate may additionally change the access controls and sharing levels of the Authorized Investigator’s data. Manager-level permission should be granted with utmost care.)\n\nThese levels are analogous to granting an Affiliate different levels of access to the Authorized Investigator’s laboratory data server. Accordingly, the Investigator must trust Affiliates granted this access and supervise and manage Affiliates granted these privileges. The Authorized Investigator must assign an expiration date to each Affiliate’s access.\n\n\nAffiliate access to Databrary\nAffiliates can only gain access to data on Databrary that has been shared by other Authorized Investigators if specifically granted that access by their supervising Authorized Investigator. The Authorized Investigator must assign an expiration date to each Affiliate’s access.\nMany Authorized Investigators grant Affiliates access only to datasets the Authorized Investigator controls, not to other datasets shared on Databrary. Some Authorized Investigators grant access to datasets shared on Databrary to senior graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, or trusted research staff.\n\n\nAccessing data shared by others\nAuthorized Investigators automatically have access to data on Databrary that has been shared by other Authorized Investigators. Affiliates only have access to shared data on Databrary only if granted that access by the Authorized Investigator who supervises them.\nRelease levels\nIn order to make it clear to participants and researchers what level of access should be granted to specific files, Databrary has developed a set of standard release levels. These levels are indicated with consistent icons and language across the site. The levels are as follows:\n\nUnknown. Consent missing or not obtained. This content is not shared and access is restricted to specific people selected by an Authorized Investigator.\nPrivate. This content is not shared and access is restricted to specific people selected by an Authorized Investigator. Note: This is the default for all files and must be specifically changed by an Authorized Investigator (or an Affiliate with suitable privileges).\nAuthorized Users. This content is restricted to authorized Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted access to shared Databrary data) and may not be redistributed in any form.\nLearning Audiences. This content is restricted to authorized Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted access to shared Databrary data), who may use clips or images from it in presentations for informational or educational purposes. Note that such presentations may be videotaped or recorded and those videos or recordings may then be made available to the public via the internet (e.g., YouTube).\nPublic. This content is available openly to anyone.\n\nAll Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must follow the restrictions on uses indicated by these release levels. Furthermore, when using files released for access by Learning Audiences Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must exercise professional judgment in deciding what clips or images to show to what audiences and in what contexts.\nNon-research uses\nMany uses of Databrary do not constitute research, for example, browsing shared videos, downloading videos of displays or procedures, or showing excerpts in research or educational presentations. Authorized Investigators (and their Affiliates) must follow Institutional policies concerning whether specific non-research uses of Databrary require prior Institutional approval. Moreover, Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must always respect the release level associated with shared files. For example, data marked with an Authorized Users release level may only be viewed in research contexts (e.g., in the Authorized Investigator’s laboratory) by the Authorized Investigator or people under the supervision of the Authorized Investigator. Similarly, only those data with a release level of Learning Audiences or Public may be shown in research or educational presentations outside the Authorized Investigator’s laboratory.\nResearch uses\nAuthorized Investigators must secure Institutional approvals prior to conducting research with data shared on Databrary. In the U.S. context, conducting secondary analysis on shared video data may not qualify as human subjects research because there is no direct contact with research participants. Still, a research project involving video data reuse may require ethics board or IRB review and approval because the data are identifiable.\nContributing new data\nOnly Authorized Investigators may create new datasets, and only Authorized Investigators may share datasets with others.\n\n\nNon-sensitive/non-identifiable data or materials\nAuthorized Investigators may upload to Databrary and share non-identifiable videos of research procedures, computer displays, research protocols, analysis code, or other research materials without any additional approvals, provided that sharing these elements with Databrary does not violate intellectual property rights of any person. De-identified or pseudonymized research data may be uploaded and shared subject to Institutional policies and approval. If an Authorized Investigator already has approval to share a de-identified or pseudonymized dataset with other researchers or with the public, then sharing that dataset on Databrary is permitted. All files uploaded to Databrary must be marked with a sharing release level. The default sharing release level is Private. While many non-sensitive/de-identified or pseudonymized data files could be made available to the public, it may be prudent to share de-identified or pseudonymized datasets only with Authorized Investigators.\n\n\nIdentifiable or sensitive data\nAuthorized Investigators must make preparations to share identifiable or sensitive data with Databrary. The next section describes some of these preparations.\n\n\nSecuring Institutional approval\nAuthorized Investigators must secure approval from their Institutions prior to sharing data with Databrary. Institutional approval usually involves research ethics board or IRB review or its equivalent. Approval to share data may be included in a new research protocol application or as an amendment to an existing protocol.\nFor human subjects data, Databrary recommends adapting the Databrary Release Template although the exact Databrary Release Template language is not required. The Databrary Release Template serves as a guideline. The Institutional research ethics board or IRB must determine what specific language should be used for securing data sharing permission and whether requesting permission to share data should be part of the research consent process or separate from it. It is essential that whatever language and permission process the Institution requires enables the Authorized Investigator to determine clearly what level of sharing release participants have granted. Authorized Investigators must be able to assign a sharing release level to each file uploaded to Databrary that reflects the sharing permission granted by the research participant.\nIn some cases, research ethics boards and IRBs have deemed that certain release language in research consent forms from previously collected data permits sharing in Databrary. This has made archival data collected prior to the creation of Databrary to be stored and shared in the library. If an Authorized Investigator has archival data, Databrary staff are happy to discuss whether and how these might be stored and shared on the system.\n\n\nRemoving data destruction clauses\nThere are often misconceptions about regulations pertaining to data destruction, especially where video or audio recordings are concerned. In the U.S., NIH and NSF do not require data destruction. Data destruction clauses inherently conflict with the ability to store and share data indefinitely via repositories like Databrary. Rather than promising to destroy data after some time period in a research protocol, Databrary recommends the following language: “Data will be stored for an indefinite period in a restricted data library on the internet (databrary.org).”\n\n\nObtaining participant release for sharing\nOnce research protocol approval has been granted, Authorized Investigators may start securing permission from participants and recording those permissions.\nAuthorized Investigators must ensure that the process used for obtaining participant release for sharing meets relevant regulatory requirements, e.g. GDPR.\n\nWhy ask\nVideo and audio recordings of participants are inherently identifiable. In order to share identifiable data on Databrary Authorized Investigators must secure permission from the people depicted in recordings or images. Authorized Investigators can share identifiable research recordings (or other identifiable data elements like birth dates) only when the Authorized Investigators (a) get approval from their Institutions to do so, (b) inform participants about what sharing these data elements means, and (c) secure participants’ permission to share. Databrary calls this data sharing permission a “release” since it involves releasing data for use by other researchers.\n\n\nWhen to ask\nDatabrary recommends that Authorized Investigators ask participants for permission to share at the end of data collection after participants have acquired first-hand knowledge about the study procedures. This ensures that consent to participate is completely separate from permission to share and the risk that asking participants about sharing their data will affect their decision about whether or not to participate in research. However, some Institutions may prefer to have Authorized Investigators incorporate data sharing permission into the research consent process or even to have data sharing permission be part of an entirely separate protocol. The important and essential point is to secure sharing permission and record it faithfully.\n\n\nHow to ask\nTo standardize the process of obtaining data sharing releases from participants—and make it as simple as possible for researchers—Databrary has developed the Databrary Release Template. The template can be added to or incorporated within human subjects research ethics protocols. The Databrary Release Template was developed and refined in close consultation with the IRB office at NYU. It gives researchers a standardized way to obtain the necessary permissions to share data in Databrary. The template makes it clear and unambiguous to participants about what agreeing to share data in Databrary will mean.\n\n\n\n\nUploading to Databrary\n\nWhat to upload\nIn addition to video, Databrary can store many types of data and supplemental files associated with a research project. These can be images, graphs, stimuli, protocols, blank questionnaires, analysis code, and consent or release documents. Databrary permits Authorized Investigators to store any information permitted by the Institution. However, some information poses greater risks to participants than others, and these should be stored on Databrary only after special consideration. For example, first or last names, home location information more specific than state, and contact information are generally considered high risk for the disclosure of participants’ identities. These data items should not be uploaded to Databrary.\nVideo and audio recordings may be uploaded to Databrary if the Authorized Investigator has secured participant (or parent) permission and the Institution approves. Under some circumstances, an Institution may determine that participant (or parent) permission is not necessary to store video and audio recordings on Databrary. For example, regarding recordings collected a long time in the past, participant (or parent) permission may be unavailable, and the Institution may determine that the risk to participants is low. Or, an Authorized Investigator may choose to store video and audio recordings on Databrary for sharing only among collaborators and Affiliates specifically chosen by the Authorized Investigator, but have no plans to share the videos with the broader Databrary community. This use of Databrary is permitted, but discouraged, as the purpose of Databrary is to foster data sharing beyond an individual research project or group.\nExact birth dates or test dates may also be considered identifiable data elements. However, these dates can be highly valuable for future research uses, and may pose a lower level of risk to participants than some other data elements. Accordingly, Databrary permits the storage of exact dates, but treats exact dates with special care. The system only exposes exact dates to Authorized Investigators or their Affiliates who upload the data, and only exposes exact dates in shared datasets if the participant has agreed to share data (grant sharing release at the Authorized User level or above).\nOther low risk data items like race, ethnicity, gender, and related personal characteristics may be stored on Databrary without specific permission.\n\n\nAssignment of sharing release level\nThe only essential item of information required for uploading files to Databrary is the sharing release level. Authorized Investigators are responsible for recording participant sharing release permissions and assigning them to files uploaded to Databrary. Databrary assigns all files a default release level of Private, so an Authorized Investigator must change the default Private release setting in order to share a file with people other than an Authorized Investigator’s Affiliates or Authorized Investigators who are research collaborators on a specific dataset.\n\n\nWho may upload\nAuthorized Investigators may upload data, and Authorized Investigators determine who among their Affiliates may also upload data to Databrary.\n\n\nWhen to upload\nAuthorized Investigators need not wait until a research project ends to upload data to Databrary. Authorized Investigators may upload files to Databrary as soon as possible after a data collection. This is called active curation. It distributes the time required to curate a dataset for sharing and thereby reduces the overall burden of data sharing.\n\n\n\nNon-human animal data\nWe are developing guidance for the use of Databrary to store non-human animal data.\n\n\nSharing data\nAuthorized Investigators determine when data stored on Databrary are ready to be shared with the broader community of Databrary Authorized Investigators. Typical ‘triggers’ for sharing a data collection are when a paper goes out for review or goes to press, when a grant report is prepared, or when a grant period ends. To share a dataset, the Authorized Investigator simply changes the access level on that dataset. This makes metadata about all data and materials visible so that other Authorized Investigators can access them, subject to the sharing release levels indicated for each file. Datasets receive a persistent identifier (DOI) when shared. Authorized Investigators may “unshare” a dataset, but except under unusual circumstances, this is not considered best practice.\n\n\nRemoving or altering participant data\nResearch participants in the European Economic Area (EEA) have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) pertaining to the use, sharing, and removal of their personal data.\nSince Databrary does not typically store information that maps personal identities to the data stored on Databrary without a separate agreement, Authorized Investigators and Institutions are responsible for responding to any requests to provide copies of, change, restrict access to, or delete a participants’ personal data stored on Databrary. Databrary cannot guarantee that personal data previously shared on Databrary can be retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who have accessed the data. Thus, in seeking permission from research participants to share personal data via Databrary, Authorized Investigators should communicate that there are limits to a participant’s right to modify or delete personal data previously shared on Databrary.\n\n\nChanging institutions\nAuthorized Investigators who change Institutions must notify Databrary of the change and its effective date. As soon as possible, the Authorized Investigator must secure authorization from their new Institution. Authorized Investigators who are awaiting authorization from their new Institution will have access to their own data but not to non-public data shared by other Authorized Investigators on Databrary. Once an Authorized Investigator has secured approval from the new Institution, full access privileges will be restored.",

    "text": "What we are asking\nWe ask your permission to share data from this session in a secure, web-based library called Databrary (databrary.org) sponsored by New York University. The data may include video/audio recordings, photographs, and images; other information about you, your child, or your family such as age, birth date, sex, ethnicity, education, and self-reported health information; and information supplied by researchers who analyze data from this session. We ask your permission to share these data because sharing will lead to faster progress in research. Giving permission to share data in Databrary is separate from consenting to participate in this research study. You do not have to give permission to share your information in Databrary. If you agree to share data, we also request permission to allow authorized Databrary researchers to show parts of the video or audio we recorded in scientific presentations and/or for informational and educational purposes. You can agree to share your data, but not agree to allow researchers to show portions of it in scientific presentations for information and educational purposes. Your choices will not affect receipt of payment if offered for participation in this or future studies.\n\n\nWill the information be confidential (kept private)?\nNo information will be included in the data library about how to contact you or your family. No data files will be identified by anyone’s name. However, other people who see the images or hear the voices of people in the recordings may recognize someone. First and/or last names of people may be spoken aloud and recorded. If the study takes place in your home, aspects of your home may be seen or heard. In addition, we may collect other information about you, your child, or your family and store it with the video or audio recordings. Thus, someone who sees the video or hears the audio might be able to identify you, your child, or other people. However, all researchers who have access to Databrary promise to keep private the identities of all people whose data are stored in Databrary.\n\n\nWho has access to information in the library?\nOnly researchers will have access to information in Databrary. Researchers must be formally authorized by their employers before gaining access to Databrary. Researchers granted access agree to use the data for scientific research and education but not commercial purposes. Researchers may download data from Databrary and they promise to treat data from Databrary with the same high standards of care and security that they treat data collected in their own laboratories.\n\n\nHow long will information remain in the library?\nData in the library will be preserved indefinitely in a secure location so that future researchers can use it. Researchers who download data from Databrary may also store the data indefinitely..\n\n\nWhat if I change my mind about sharing?\nDatabrary does not store information that links your identity to specific files. Therefore, if you want to revoke permission to share data or want a copy of data stored on Databrary, you must contact the researcher conducting this study (NAME OF PI: CONTACT INFORMATION). If you revoke permission to share, Databrary cannot guarantee that data shared prior to the date you revoked permission can be retrieved.\nInformation in the library will be preserved indefinitely in a secure location so that future researchers can use it. Permission to share can be revoked, but information previously shared cannot be retrieved. To revoke sharing permission, contact NAME OF PI: CONTACT INFORMATION. For questions, contact ethics@databrary.org.\n\n\nWhere is Databrary located?\nDatabrary is located in the United States and is accessible over the internet. This means that data stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and reused by authorized researchers located anywhere in the world.\n\n\nCompensation\nThere will be no compensation for sharing information in the library. [IF ORAL OR WRITTEN ASSENT TO SHARE DATA IS NEEDED, USE THE FOLLOWING SCRIPT]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAssent to Share Script\n\n\n\nSpoken to child by Experimenter:\nEarlier, we asked you if you wanted to be in the study and if we could record you while you [describe task]. You said yes. Right now, only the people who work in this room will see the recordings of you or other information about you from this session. Is it okay with you if we put these recordings and other information about you in a library so that other scientists who don’t work in this room can also see it? There are many other scientists who want to learn about how children grow and change, but they can’t because they don’t work in this room.\nIf you say yes, only other scientists who have approval to use the library will see the recordings or other information. Your friends, your teachers, and your classmates won’t be able to see them unless you say it is okay.\nYou can talk this over with your parents before you decide if you want your recordings and other information to be in the library. I will also ask your parents to give their permission for your recordings to be in the library, but even if your parents say “yes” you can still say “no” and decide not to put your recordings in the library. If you don’t want your recordings and other information to be in the library, we don’t have to put them in there. Remember, having your recordings and other information in the library is up to you. No one will be upset if you don’t want the recordings and other information to be in there.\nYou can ask any questions that you have about the library. If you have a question later that you didn’t think of now, you can call me or ask [your parents, teacher, whoever the child may choose] to call me at [telephone number].\nWould you allow your recordings and other information to be stored in the library?\n[Participant answers yes or no; only a definite yes may be taken as permission to share.]\nORAL ASSENT: Researcher must record response in signature table and initial.\nWRITTEN ASSENT: If you can read and write, and want to have your recordings and other information stored in the library, I can show you the box to check in the signature table.\nWould you allow other people besides scientists working in the library to see parts of the recordings?\n[Participant answers yes or no; only a definite yes may be taken as permission to share.]\nORAL ASSENT: Researcher must record response in signature table and initial.\nWRITTEN ASSENT: If you can read and write, and you want to allow other people to see parts of the recordings, I can show you the box to check in the signature table.\n\n\n\n\nSignatures\nAll people in the session must decide whether to provide permission for the following:\n\nPermission to share with authorized researchers\nI give permission to share data from this session with authorized researchers in a secure library called Databrary.

    "text": "E.1 Sample email to use for sending the Databrary Release Form to participants after their visit\nSometimes researchers cannot obtain release from participants for sharing at the time of the visit. When it is possible to recontact families to re-consent them to ask for their Databrary release, we have created language that can be used to communicate to parents to ask for their release to share video data with Databrary.\nDear Parent,\nPreviously, you visited [LAB NAME] lab to participate in a study on [RESEARCH AREA]. The data that researchers like me collect from babies and families are incredibly valuable for helping to understand how children learn and develop. There are many different ways that children are learning and developing all the time. They are learning to move, to talk, to interact with people, to understand the world around them, and so much more. Video recordings collected at labs like mine are so rich that one researcher can never study every aspect of a child’s development. There’s huge potential for other child development researchers to use the same videos to learn about many different aspects of how children grow and develop!\nThe information that you provided when you participated is incredibly useful to me and I am truly grateful.\nI’ve recently joined a new initiative, called Databrary, that aims to make video recordings and data like the data you provided when you participated in my study, accessible to other researchers so that we all can understand more about child development in a more efficient and collaborative way.\nI now have a new request. I’d like to ask if you are comfortable allowing us to share the data we collected from your session with other researchers just like me. The data would be shared in a secure, online library and would not be available to the public. Only approved researchers that are at a university and have been vouched for by their university officials would be able to access the videos and information shared in the library. The data shared on Databrary will never be used for commercial purposes. Your personal contact information will never be uploaded to Databrary and researchers will never have access to it.\nIf you agree, I’ve attached a permission form that you can sign and email back to me. There are two levels of permissions, the first is to ask if you give permission to share your data through Databrary with other researchers just like me. The second level asks whether you would allow other professors/researchers like me to show short bits of the videos to students or researchers for educational and scientific purposes.\nIt is completely alright if you would not like to share the video from your session. Sharing does not affect your future participation in visits to the lab or the importance of your contribution to science and the field.\nKind Regards, [PI NAME/LAB]",

Data are linked to participants by subject ID. However, video data are potentially identifiable because participants’ faces are visible and their names may be heard. With participant consent, study data will be stored on Databrary, a secure web-based video library housed at NYU, allowing permission-based access to coders from all labs comprising the project team. At the end of each lab visit, caregivers will be asked whether they are comfortable: 1) storing their videos and children’s birthdates and other metadata on Databrary, and 2) sharing their data with authorized researchers outside of this protocol who are members of the academic research and clinical communities authorized to access Databrary. If caregivers agree to video sharing, the videos will be made available to authorized researchers as outlined below. If caregivers do not agree, their videos will be accessible only by researchers on the project protocol and not shared with the larger community. The policies for sharing videos and other potentially identifiable data on Databrary have been carefully developed and monitored with the advice of the legal counsel, grants/contracts office, and IRBs of both New York University and The Pennsylvania State University. Currently, more than 360 institutions in the U.S. and around the world have formally approved the Databrary Access Agreement to enable video sharing and reuse. Parents also will be told that they can share portions of data or ask for particular sessions not to be shared while sharing other sessions.",

Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, and researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators and under their supervision, are authorized for access.\nAuthorized users are required to sign a user access agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories.\nOnly videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording are made available to the community of authorized Databrary users. In consultation with ethics board officials at New York University and the Pennsylvania State University, Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data.\nFederal policies do not require re-consenting of minor participants when they reach the age of majority, if re-consenting is impractical or otherwise increases risks to participants (e.g., by requiring researchers to maintain links between identifiable information and collected data for extended time periods).",

    "text": "13. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nIf you are a resident of or are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you may have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Personal data you provide is only collected with your consent, and may be transmitted outside of the EEA to Databrary (or computer servers maintained for the benefit of Databrary) pursuant to that consent.\nIn general, under the GDPR you may:\n\nrequest access to your personal data.\nhave incomplete or incorrect data corrected.\nhave your personal data deleted.\nsuspend or restrict our use of your personal data, or withdraw your consent.\nrequest a copy of your personal data.\ncomplain to a supervisory authority if you believe your rights under the GDPR are not being respected.\n\nShould you request a copy of your personal data, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.\nShould you request the deletion of your personal data, Databrary will generally do so as soon as practicable, although your right to have your personal data deleted is subject to exceptions, such as, for example, compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes on data-protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.\nContact Databrary at contact@databrary.org if you have concerns regarding your personal data, or wish to exercise any of these listed rights.\nNote that, if you are in the EEA, we may transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, including to the United States. By way of example, this may happen if your personal data is transferred to our servers located in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not have similar data-protection laws to the EEA. By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing, or processing. If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy. As part of New York University, Databrary shares NYU’s appointed Data Protection Officer. For more information, email info@databrary.org.\n\nGDPR and Research Contents\nBecause Databrary’s Contents are stored on servers located in the United States, Restricted Data stored on Databrary may be accessed and re-used by researchers outside of the EEA. As described in the Databrary Access Agreement, Institutions and Authorized Users have obligations to ensure that consent sufficient to meet GDPR provisions was obtained from research participants prior to storing information on Databrary or sharing it with other Authorized Users. The same requirement to ensure that adequate consent to meet GDPR provisions was obtained from research participants applies when you, an Authorized User, downloads Contents shared by other Authorized Users from any jurisdiction.",

Researchers are asked to avoid the inclusion of extraneous personally identifiable information (PII) in videos uploaded to Databrary.

Because of this, sensitive or identifiable data shared with Databrary will only be viewable and downloadable to authorized users who have been granted secure access by Databrary’s administrators. Select data may be made available to the public, but only as determined by the researcher and on the basis of participant permission. Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, or researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators, will be authorized for access.\nAuthorized users will be required to sign a user agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories.\nAlthough Databrary will store complete study data, only videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording will be made available to the community of authorized users. Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data.\nData owners can choose to share their data at any point, either as they collect their data, or only once data collection has completed.",
