Why should I use Databrary?", " Chapter 1 About Databrary Databrary is a restricted access data library that is specialized for storing, streaming, and sharing video and audio recordings collected as research data or documentation. Databrary supports sharing of many types of research data and documentation beyond video and audio. Based at New York University, Databrary’s mission is to support data sharing among researchers in the behavioral, social, educational, developmental, neural, and computer sciences. Databrary is also a resource for and a community of scientists who use video or audio in their research or teaching. We encourage you to read Databrary’s Access Agreement and its annexes. These documents, especially Annex III–Databrary Access Guide, provide extensive information about how Databrary is structured and how it should be used. You may also get guidance about working with a research ethics board or IRB or see how to incorporate data sharing using Databrary in a Data Management Plan for a grant proposal. Look up a term in the glossary if something doesn’t make sense, or contact us directly for one-on-one support. Support Databrary is grateful to have received financial and in-kind support from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Society for Research in Child Development, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the James S. McDonnell Foundation, The LEGO Foundation, New York University, and the Pennsylvania State University. Code base Databrary’s code base is open source and is hosted on GitHub. What is my role? As an Institution Institutions are responsible for overseeing the researchers at their institution and for monitoring their use of Databrary and its resources. As a Researcher I must have human subjects training (e.g. CITI training), be employed at an institution that has an ethics or Institutional Review Board, and be able to conduct independent research at my institution. I would like to reuse or upload data to Databrary. I need to read and sign a Databrary Access agreement and its’ Annexes (I, II, III) before I may be authorized. I can sponsor lab staff/students that are working on my projects to see my data or others data on Databrary. As a Student or Staff I can only use non-public content on Databrary AFTER my supervisor has been granted authorization by their institution. This may take longer than I anticipate, so I will ask for authorization as early as possible. I must also have human subjects training (e.g. CITI training). Why should I use Databrary? Videos are expensive and time consuming to collect. It is likely that another researcher could answer their research questions by utilizing my videos. Many granting agencies require that data are shared. Databrary is a way to share video data and link the published papers and other repositories (e.g. GitHub) to it. "],["ethics-and-grants.html", "Chapter 2 Ethics and Grants Databrary Ethics Ethics/IRB Review Permission to share Sharing release levels Sharing data collected without a Databrary-specific release Grants Internal Data Use Agreement Information", " Chapter 2 Ethics and Grants Databrary Ethics Databrary strives to uphold the highest research ethics while maximizing open and secure access to research data. We achieve this through multiple means: Requiring that researchers fulfill all institutional requirements, including ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) review if needed, in order to use Databrary materials. Providing researchers with template language that may be used to apply for and secure ethics board approval. Requiring researchers to ask research participants for their permission to share data and providing template language to guide the process. We also provide a template for securing sharing permission from research staff that are recorded. Providing a sample participant data sharing release script and example videos of the data sharing release process. Sample Email requesting data sharing release when it is not possible to obtain permission at the time of the visit Developing consistent terminology and visual icons for documenting sharing release levels. Providing guidance about when and how data collected previously might be stored and shared on Databrary. Ethics/IRB Review Below is boilerplate language prepared by Databrary that researchers can use to help draft applications to their institutional review board (IRB). This document is intended to help researchers who plan to store and share video data in Databrary prepare IRB materials for approval. Researchers should confirm institution/agency/directorate/program-specific application requirements before submission. Please contact us at contact@databrary.org for further assistance. Secondary Reuse This project will conduct secondary analyses of participant data obtained from Databrary, an online platform for the storage, sharing, and re-use of video and other research data. Participants’ consent for study participation and release of data were obtained by the original researcher under the oversight of their institutional review board. Because there is no direct contact with participants as a part of this project, the level of additional risk to participants is low. Primary data collection Data will be handled by the team of researchers approved on the IRB protocols of all Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators. Data are linked to participants by subject ID. However, video data are potentially identifiable because participants’ faces are visible and their names may be heard. With participant consent, study data will be stored on Databrary, a secure web-based video library housed at NYU, allowing permission-based access to coders from all labs comprising the project team. At the end of each lab visit, caregivers will be asked whether they are comfortable: 1) storing their videos and children’s birthdates and other metadata on Databrary, and 2) sharing their data with authorized researchers outside of this protocol who are members of the academic research and clinical communities authorized to access Databrary. If caregivers agree to video sharing, the videos will be made available to authorized researchers as outlined below. If caregivers do not agree, their videos will be accessible only by researchers on the project protocol and not shared with the larger community. The policies for sharing videos and other potentially identifiable data on Databrary have been carefully developed and monitored with the advice of the legal counsel, grants/contracts office, and IRBs of both New York University and The Pennsylvania State University. Currently, more than 360 institutions in the U.S. and around the world have formally approved the Databrary Access Agreement to enable video sharing and reuse. Parents also will be told that they can share portions of data or ask for particular sessions not to be shared while sharing other sessions. Policies for Databrary access and data sharing Sensitive or identifiable data shared with Databrary will only be viewable to and downloadable by authorized users who have been granted secure access by Databrary’s administrators. Select data may be made available to the public, but only as determined by the researcher and on the basis of participant permission. Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, and researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators and under their supervision, are authorized for access. Authorized users are required to sign a user access agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories. Only videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording are made available to the community of authorized Databrary users. In consultation with ethics board officials at New York University and the Pennsylvania State University, Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data. Federal policies do not require re-consenting of minor participants when they reach the age of majority, if re-consenting is impractical or otherwise increases risks to participants (e.g., by requiring researchers to maintain links between identifiable information and collected data for extended time periods). Policies and provisions for reuse and redistribution Access to videos and metadata will be available for educational and research purposes, subject to participant consent. Such access will be provided using the Databrary web-based application. Materials generated under the project will be disseminated in accordance with the policies of [GRANT-GIVING ORGANIZATION] and participating institutions. Publication of data shall occur during the project, if appropriate, or at the end of the project, consistent with normal scientific practices. Archiving and preservation of research data Data in Databrary will be preserved indefinitely in a secure data storage facility at New York University (NYU); the facility is managed by the university’s Information Technology Services department. Central IT staff handle storage, network, and backup systems. NYU does routine tape backups that are stored off site and performs regular file fixity checks to monitor the integrity of stored assets. Federal regulations do not require that data be destroyed after a particular time period if they are stored indefinitely in a recognized repository. Data Security Data and metadata stored in Databrary are subject to the security policies and best practices implemented by NYU. For more information about these policies and services, please visit NYU ITS Computer &amp; Network Security at https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/cybersecurity.html. Permission to share Sharing release template forms for download Data sharing release templates for Participants and Lab Staff. Sample Script for requesting permission to share Now that you have finished this session, there’s one more thing we want to ask you. The data that researchers collect from babies and families are incredibly valuable for helping scientists to understand how children develop. So we wanted to ask if you are comfortable with allowing us to share the data we collected from this session with other researchers just like the professor who runs this lab/project. The data would be shared in a secure, online library, it’s not available to the public– only researchers that are authorized by their University would be able to access the information in the library. This permission form also asks whether you would allow other professors/ researchers like Dr. [PI’s Name] to show short bits of the videos to students or researchers for educational and scientific purposes. These data will not be used or shown for commercial purposes. Videos Example videos of requesting permission to share participant data on Databrary: https://databrary.org/support/irb/examples.html Sharing release levels Insert picture of sharing release levels here: https://databrary.org/support/irb/release-levels.html Sharing data collected without a Databrary-specific release Does your consent form permit you to show or reuse recordings for educational and scientific purposes? If you already use a video/audio or photo release form and want to find out whether you can share with Databrary, follow the following steps. Seek formal permission from your IRB If your release permits you to show recordings in educational or scientific settings, you may apply for formal permission from your IRB to share these recordings with Databrary. Please note: Databrary intends to store Data indefinitely Some IRBs encourage researchers to include promises to destroy Data, especially recordings, after some fixed time period in order to limit risk to participants. Data destruction is antithetical to data sharing, and Databrary’s Template Release language seeks explicit permission to share data indefinitely. NIH and NSF do not require data destruction clauses. Researchers who wish to store Data on Databrary should remove data destruction clauses from their informed consent documents for new Data and seek IRB guidance about whether archival Data can be shared. Determine what sharing permission level applies Authorized Users Release: Your current release mean that recordings can be shared only for research use by other Databrary Investigators Learning Audiences: Clips from those recordings be shown in educational and scientific contexts Share data with Databrary You may create a new volume yourself or contact Databrary for help in doing so. Grants Many users want to know how to incorporate data sharing using Databrary in funding proposals to agencies like the U.S. National Science Foundation or National Institutes of Health. Researchers should confirm funding agency, directorate, or program-specific resource sharing plans or data management plan requirements. Data Management Plan Template Below is boilerplate language prepared by Databrary that researchers can use to help draft data management or resource sharing plans. This document is intended to help researchers who plan to store and share video data in Databrary prepare grant materials for submission. The material here is particularly suited to NSF application requirements, but similar language can be adapted for NIH grants as well as private foundations. Please contact us at contact@databrary.org for further assistance. Researchers should confirm institution/agency/directorate/program-specific resource sharing plan or data management plan requirements. Data Formats Databrary transcodes all deposited video data into standard and HTML5-compatible formats, currently H.264+AAC as MP4. It stores the original video file along with the transformed, web accessible video file. Databrary stores other data in their original formats (e.g., .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .csv, .pdf, .jpg, .png). As standards for preferred video file formats change over time, Databrary will perform file format migrations to those preferred formats. Metadata Databrary takes and stores metadata related to a full dataset (e.g., title, authors, related publication, description of study, keywords or tags, associated URLs), individual study sessions (e.g. metadata related to participants, study groups and conditions, location, language, and session date and tasks), and video files (e.g., title, duration, tags) related to a dataset. Metadata is added through a user-friendly web interface where auto-completion, suggested terms, and integration with third party services (e.g., CrossRef) guide users through its creation. Metadata may be accessed through the web interface, via API, or downloaded as a comma separated values (CSV) file. Documentation Data owners can upload and store on Databrary any number of related documents that assist other researchers in understanding their data (e.g. study protocol, coding manuals, output from video coding software, and procedural videos). These documents can be associated with the dataset as a whole, or with individual sessions within the dataset. Policies for access and sharing Data will be stored with, and shared through, Databrary. Researchers are asked to avoid the inclusion of extraneous personally identifiable information (PII) in videos uploaded to Databrary. However, given the nature of video, it might still be possible to identify individuals based on first names, facial features, or details of the environment. Because of this, sensitive or identifiable data shared with Databrary will only be viewable and downloadable to authorized users who have been granted secure access by Databrary’s administrators. Select data may be made available to the public, but only as determined by the researcher and on the basis of participant permission. Only researchers with Principal Investigator status from institutions with Institutional Review Boards or similar review entities, or researchers affiliated with Principal Investigators, will be authorized for access. Authorized users will be required to sign a user agreement that specifies that they will: (1) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the data; (2) abide by ethical principles for treatment of human subjects as mandated by their local Institutional Review Boards; (3) agree not use the data for commercial purposes; and (4) treat data in Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories. Although Databrary will store complete study data, only videos and other identifiable data that have been permissioned for sharing by all the depicted individuals in each recording will be made available to the community of authorized users. Databrary has developed template Sharing Release forms that contributors can add to their IRB protocol. These forms allow researchers to ask participants for permission to share their data. Data owners can choose to share their data at any point, either as they collect their data, or only once data collection has completed. Policies and provisions for reuse and redistribution Access to videos and metadata will be available for educational and research purposes, subject to participant consent. Such access will be provided using the Databrary web-based application. Materials generated under the project will be disseminated in accordance with the policies of [GRANT-GIVING ORGANIZATION] and participating institutions. Publication of data shall occur during the project, if appropriate, or at the end of the project, consistent with normal scientific practices. Plans for archiving and preservation Data in Databrary will be preserved indefinitely in a secure data storage facility at New York University (NYU). The facility is managed by the university’s Information Technology Services department. Central IT staff handle storage, network, and backup systems. NYU does routine tape backups that are stored off site and performs regular file fixity checks to monitor the integrity of stored assets. Versioning of stored assets Files uploaded to Databrary are assigned a unique identifier and have metadata associating them to files that are uploaded to replace them. Though only the latest version of a file is exposed to Databrary site users. Files, once uploaded, are never deleted. Data Security Data and metadata stored in Databrary are subject to the security policies and best practices implemented by NYU. For more information about these policies and services, please visit NYU ITS Computer &amp; Network Security at https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/cybersecurity.html. Internal Data Use Agreement Information This Agreement is different from a traditional DUA because there is no obligation for authorized investigators to use or to contribute data. Once our researchers are planning to share data from their lab or repurpose shared data, they would seek proper IRB approval for those activities. The Data on Databrary Contains PII HIPAA data is not stored on Databrary Does the Consent Form used to collect the data permit its disclosure or has it been authorized by the relevant IRB(s)? Yes All data on Databrary were collected and shared under the supervision of an IRB. What is the purpose of the Data Exchange? The purpose of Databrary is to share research data between researchers to foster data reuse. Describe the data being exchanged: The data are primarily video data of behavioral research in addition to stimuli that have been used for research studies.

Description of dataset It is not helpful to just copy and paste the article abstract in the dataset overview. Instead, it should contain information regarding the context of data collection and the types of data uploaded (e.g. video, pictures, programming code). “This dataset includes videos of real-life falls experienced by older adult residents of long-term care homes.” is more useful than “Researchers can study complex developmental phenomena with all the inherent noise and complexity or simplify behaviors to hone in on the essential aspects of a phenomenon.” Useful description of data set: This qualitative study interviewed 22 adult residents of two Boston-area communities, to find out about their difficulties paying water utility bills, the coping strategies they rely on to manage unaffordable water bills, and associated health effects. The dataset includes: 22 interview transcripts (RTF files) Participant attribute table Code book Additional sentence to be added if entire volume is not shared: Requests for sharing will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Please contact person@university.edu for all inquiries and requests regarding this dataset. Abstract can be added as supplemental information but should not be the only thing in the description. Add year(s) when data was collected External links Volumes should have external links to the following: The journal article (if it’s been published) The parent volume Other DB volumes that use the parent volume data (ex. the many LEGO projects) Project website (ex. PLAY project volume should link to PLAY website) Organizing the data itself Individual sessions folders for each participant’s video data Do not share birth date or test date publicly but can share age, gender, race, ethnicity, language, group, tasks, and context (lab/home, state, country) If pulling videos from a “parent” volume, should researchers re-download and re-upload the videos? Or just keep them in the parent volume and link out to that said volume? Exemplar folder with videos that are public. If public permissoin is not explicitly given, blurred out faces of participants.

Children came from diverse backgrounds (African-American, Dominican, Mexican, Chinese) and lived in the New York City metro area. Videos were recorded during various activities and tasks specific to each observation age (e.g., book reading, mother-child free play, novel toy, familiar toy at the 14-month visit) in children’s homes or in the laboratory at 14, 24, 36, 52, 64, and 76 months of age.” LEGO: The project includes a corpus of 234 hours of video recording (across 2 days, 2 hours per visit) of infants and mothers going about their daily routines. We video coded foundational passes on infant object play, motor play, and language behaviours, thereby producing rich descriptive data on how infants play, how play changes across the course of a day and the second year, and which environmental and social factors support infant play. This project yields several valuable products that are disseminated to and shared with the scientific community, parents, and other stakeholders. 10.1 Other best practices ideas when do I need a new volume or the same volume when do I use materials folder ## How I do describe data? ensure DATA description is complete EG. what file types are included do not just paste abstract avoid acronyms or lab conventions describe displays and task agnostic to research question bad - complimentary gesture study good - videos of child and parent playing with 3 toys from 3 camera angles "],["frequently-asked-questions.html", "Chapter 11 Frequently Asked Questions I qualify as an Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR).

Can I sign as both Authorized Investigator and AOR? No. If you qualify as an Authorized Organizational Representative you will need to have the staff member above you on an organizational chart sign for you. Can individuals not associated with an institution be authorized? No. To become an Authorized Investigator on Databrary you/your institution must meet All of the below conditions: Have PI status or you are eligible to conduct independent research at this Institution and the Institution accepts responsibility for its Authorized Investigators’ actions related to the use of Databrary Have all current research ethics training that addresses human subjects policy and issues required by your institution; and Your institution must maintain an ethics or Institutional Review Board with U.S.-equivalent standards that reviews and approves research involving human subjects, Be part of an institution that grants you the authority to choose and manage affiliates who meet Databrary’s qualifications and who agree to follow Databrary’s ethical principles, and The person executing this Access Agreement on behalf of the Institution has the authority to do so Data on Databrary is provided for non-commercial and non-personal use only and is subject to the terms of use outlined in the Databrary Access Agreement. How much does Databrary cost? There is no cost to use Databrary. How is Databrary funded? Databrary is supported through grants from federal agencies, and private foundations. Where is Databrary located? Databrary is located at New York University (NYU). All data is stored on servers that are maintained by NYU IT staff. I did all registration and authorization steps on Databrary. I need to download a data set. My supervising professor has registered and gave me access but I still can’t download it. Your supervising professor did register and requested access to Databrary. Access is not immediate. Your supervising professor and an authorized signatory on behalf of the university must review and approve the agreement. After Databrary receives the completed agreement, we may grant Databrary authorization to your supervising professor. The time it takes for this to be completed depends on the internal requirements of each institution. Does Databrary offer “blind review”? Databrary is a restricted access data repository that promotes the storage and sharing of identifiable and sensitive data. As such, Databrary has unique policies to protect the privacy of research participants. These policies govern who can access identifiable data and under what circumstances. The policies are codified in a formal access agreement that binds NYU, Databrary’s parent institution, and similar institutions where Databrary’s users conduct research. For the forseeable future, these policies make it impossible to support full double-blinded anonymous review of data and materials. While some data and materials are shared with the public, Databrary restricts access to sensitive and identifiable information to people who have received authorization from an institution or to those whose access is supervised by an authorized investigator. Only authorized investigators can create and share datasets. Dataset creators, not Databrary, determine what level of sharing is appropriate for individual data files and for datasets as a whole. So, the level of access a reviewer can have to a dataset depends on two things: Has the dataset been shared with the Databrary community? Does the reviewer have authorization from an institution to view restricted data or materials? If both answers are yes, the reviewer may fully vet a shared dataset. Databrary does not report on access to specific datasets, so the reviewer can remain anonymous. Databrary does not mask the identities of dataset owners, so the blinding is only one-way. If the dataset is shared, but the reviewer does not have authorization from an institution, the reviewer can confirm that a shared dataset exists, that the dataset has a persistent identifier, and that the dataset has a specific number of shared restricted access files. The reviewer may also examine any items that are shared with the public, stimuli, protocol, aggregated and de-identified datasets, etc. What if an authorized investigator is leaving their institution for another institution but should still retain authorized investigator status? The authorized investigator would need to meet all criteria required for authorization at both institutions. 11.1 As an authorized investigator moving to another institution, do I need to be re-authorized by my new institution?

Click on the Edit Button (the small pencil) Ensure the appropriate file is highlighted in gray. Click ‘Replace File’ at the top right of the screen Navigate in the files pane to the correct file then select Open I just uploaded a video file onto Databrary and it says my uploading is complete. Why can’t I see it on or download it from Databrary right away? I downloaded files from Databrary, but the filenames are truncated. When Databrary downloads files there is a 32 character filename limit. Please ensure the file names do not exceed this. If the file name is too long (the first 32 characters of the filename are exactly the same), it is impossible to distinguish between these files when they download and only one file will be downloaded. I have a dataset that has been completely collected. Now we are ready to share with Databrary. What do I do? Send an Email to Databrary so they may assist you. You will need to include answers to the following questions: What is the name and email address for PI for this project? Do you have permission to share these data with the Databrary community? Was a Data Sharing Release or something similar completed at the time of Data Collection? Do you have permission from your IRB or Research Ethics Board used at your institution to share these data with Databrary? How many files are there for this dataset? What file types do you have (e.g. .mov, .mp4, .mp3, .pdf, .xls)? Databrary Supported File Formats What is the total size of dataset (X GB)? How many different sessions/participants do you have? Do you have materials to share (e.g. data collection instructions, survey questions) in addition to the videos collected for the study? Discuss this project with the Databrary Team to determine the next steps. Format your data with the same file structure for all sessions/participants insert picture examples Share data folder with the Databrary Support Specialist on Box.

Is there a recommendation on volume/file naming schemes? Try naming the each Volume: ProjectName_SITEID The Short Name is INTERNAL only to volume Investigators and Collaborators Where each SITEID has a unique id to each site, typically with the same number of characters. Each file uploaded can have a standard naming scheme which includes the SITEID. In the Volume Description, list the name of the university/institution in full. This allows for use of an API pull to ingest data when necessary. After all data are collected, a new volume with ALL of the final data, including which data are from which site, can be created. I have a multisite study. How do I add my co-investigators in the right order to the Databrary volume? I am an authorized investigator.

You do not need to re-execute the entire Databrary Access Agreement for additional investigators. NOTE: Do not complete this section for the first Authorized Investigator at your institution, who will instead sign on Page 1 of the full Databrary Access Agreement. Acknowledgement by Authorized Investigator As an Authorized Investigator, I acknowledge that I have read and understand the terms of this agreement. Name of Authorized Investigator: _______________________________ Title of Authorized Investigator: _______________________________ Signature of Authorized Investigator: _______________________________ Date: ________________ Approval by Institution As the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR), my signature below indicates that I have authority to bind my Institution under this agreement. Name of Institution: _______________________________ Name of AOR: _______________________________ Title of AOR: _______________________________ Signature of AOR: _______________________________ Date: ________________ Annex III – Databrary Access Guide Version date: April 29, 2020 This Databrary Access Guide provides information useful for Institutions and Authorized Investigators who wish to use Databrary’s services. For Institutions Databrary is a restricted access data library specialized for storing, streaming, and sharing of video and audio recordings. Databrary’s mission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and related data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral, educational, and neural sciences. The responsibility for protecting research data and research participants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates, Institutions, and Databrary. Databrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video and related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is restricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by their Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of Authorized Investigators through a research ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S. Government (see: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html). Authorized Investigators who share data with others must secure permission to share from research participants and record that permission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized Investigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other Authorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles, including respect for the sharing permissions granted by research participants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights of research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data. The Databrary Access Agreement permits data use and data contribution Databrary restricts access to Authorized Investigators whose Institutions sign a formal Databrary Access Agreement. The Databrary Access Agreement combines provisions for data use and data contribution. Unlike data use agreements that allow specific individuals access to a particular dataset for a discrete research purpose, the Databrary Access Agreement allows any Authorized Investigator to access all shared datasets on Databrary and use the datasets for many different Institutionally-approved purposes. In addition, the Databrary Access Agreement permits Authorized Investigators to upload data and to share it with other Authorized Investigators in accord with the sharing permissions granted by participants and any required Institutional approvals. Databrary believes that combining data use and data contribution in a single agreement reduces barriers to data sharing, meets emerging funder mandates to share research data, and accelerates progress in research. Video’s use cases extend beyond research In addition to its many uses in research, video may be used for a variety of pre-research and non-research uses, such as the documentation of methodological details, the demonstration of computer-based tasks, or the showing of video clips for teaching or scientific presentations. Databrary encourages the storage and sharing of video for all of these purposes, in a manner consistent with subject permissions and institutional approvals. Institutions determine when research ethics board or IRB approval is necessary Databrary does not require prior research ethics board or IRB approval for an Authorized Investigator to be granted access to the system or to use Databrary’s shared resources for non-research, educational, or pre-research uses. However, in signing the Databrary Access Agreement, all Authorized Investigators promise to secure research ethics approval whenever their use of Databrary requires it under the Institution’s policies. Non-research, educational, or pre-research use cases may not require research ethics board or IRB review and approval at every institution. Institutions decide which use cases require research ethics board or IRB review and approval. What data are shared Databrary contains images, video, and audio recordings that may be identifiable, data and metadata that are not typically sensitive, and de-identified data. Exact birth dates may be stored for use in calculating exact ages, but exact birth dates are only exposed to Authorized Investigators or Affiliates given specific access to data. Names, addresses, email addresses, financial information, government ID numbers, detailed geographic location information, and other personally identifiable data elements are not stored and shared on Databrary. Securing permission to share In order to contribute and share identifiable data with Databrary, Authorized Investigators must secure permission to store the recordings on Databrary from research participants and any other people (e.g., research staff) who are recorded. Databrary has developed a Sharing Release Template that informs people depicted in recordings of the potential risks associated with sharing video and other data on Databrary. The Sharing Release Template is one of the resources that Databrary has made available to researchers. The Sharing Release Template may be adapted for use at any Institution and added to any research ethics or IRB protocol. However, an Institution may require other release language in order to provide equivalent protections. Whether de-identified or pseudonymized data may be shared with Databrary without seeking explicit permission from research participants depends on the Authorized Investigator’s Institution. Some ethics boards or IRBs may allow de-identified or pseudonymized data to be shared without the explicit permission of the research participant. Uploading data and assigning sharing permission levels Authorized Investigators who upload data to Databrary must assign to each file uploaded the level of data sharing granted by research participants—from none to public access. The sharing level assigned to each file by default is Private, meaning that no person other than the Authorized Investigator who uploaded the file and any Affiliates granted access by the Authorized Investigator, may view the file. Not only are data files assigned a Private sharing level by default, but all newly created datasets are initially made Private, accessible only to an Authorized Investigator, any Affiliates the Authorized Investigator selects, and any other individual Authorized Investigators granted specific access to the dataset. An Authorized Investigator may elect to create an overview of a dataset when it is created and make the overview publicly available. The overview can serve as the public face of the dataset while the dataset is being collected and analyzed. This can be useful in documenting progress on a research grant to sponsors. The dataset overview does not expose data unless the Authorized Investigator chooses to do so. Sharing data At a time when the Authorized Investigator chooses—e.g., when a paper goes to press or a grant period ends—the Authorized Investigator may choose to share the dataset with other Authorized Investigators on Databrary. This makes the data contained in the dataset available to other Authorized Investigators and possibly the public, but only in accordance with the sharing levels selected by Authorized Investigators and always subject to the permission granted by participants. That is, individual data files marked Private remain accessible only to people the Authorized Investigator specifically selects. Similarly, access to datasets labeled Private remains solely under the control of the Authorized Investigator. Databrary and GDPR Authorized Investigators may collect personal data from research participants who have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the European Economic Area (EEA). Databrary’s servers are currently located in the United States, and data stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and re-used by Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the EEA. There are more than 500 Institutions across the globe that have signed the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of Authorized Investigators who have access to shared research data at https://nyu.databrary.org/search?volume=false&amp;f.party_authorization=4&amp;f.party_is_institution=false. In seeking permission to collect data from research participants governed by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants information about who may have access to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored. Institutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that satisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of GDPR. Databrary does not typically store information that links a person’s identity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between the Authorized Investigator, the Institution, and Databrary to store this type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy of data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal data that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or Institution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary. Also, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other Authorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who accessed a participant’s personal data prior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators should communicate to research participants that there are limits to a participant’s right to modify or delete personal data that have already been shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains language for this purpose. When accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators, Institutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have given in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR provisions. When Authorized Investigators leave an Institution Authorized Investigators are expected to inform Databrary when they leave an Institution. Institutions may also inform Databrary. Access to non-public data shared with other Authorized Investigators will be suspended when an Authorized Investigator leaves an Institution. The suspension extends to an Authorized Investigators’ Affiliates. Authorized Investigators will continue to have password-protected access to data they uploaded to Databrary once they leave an Institution. When a new Institution grants authorization, Authorized Investigators will regain access to non-public data shared by other Authorized Investigators. If an Authorized Investigator retires, is incapacitated due to illness, or dies, the Institution should inform Databrary so that the Authorized Investigator’s account may be suspended. An Institution may choose to designate a data steward for the Authorized Investigator’s data and authorize that person to manage access to the data. If the Institution does not identify and authorize a data steward, Databrary staff will serve that role. However, the Databrary staff serving as data steward will not change the data sharing status of any specific dataset without explicit written guidance from the Institution. Selecting Affiliates If permitted by their Institution, an Authorized Investigator may grant a person outside their Institution Affiliate status. Institutions may establish policies governing the selection and management of Affiliates by their Authorized Investigators. If a person is eligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home Institution, that person must apply for access to Databrary through their home Institution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers eligible to be Authorized Investigators at their home Institution should not be granted access to Databrary as the Affiliate of another Authorized Investigator either from the same Institution or a different one. Databrary welcomes questions about these policies. Please email contact@databrary.org. For Researchers This section explains how to apply for authorization, select and manage affiliates, collect data that can be shared, upload and manage datasets and studies, and explore, re-use, and extend the resources shared with Databrary. Getting Authorized Some materials on Databrary are available to the public, but access to most data requires that a person secure formal written authorization from an Institution. The Databrary Access Agreement is the legally binding document that formalizes the authorization process. Individuals who are eligible to conduct independent research, submit funding proposals as the lead investigator, have Principal Investigator (PI) status, or have tenure-track faculty positions at their Institution, may apply to their Institution for approval to be named an Authorized Investigator. To receive authorization a person must apply for and receive authorization from their Institution; Databrary does not grant authorization separate from an Institution. In the U.S., a college or university’s grants and contracts or sponsored programs office usually takes responsibility for granting authorization by signing the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary staff will work with a researcher and an Institution to secure signatures on the Databrary Access Agreement. The authorization process typically takes a few days to a few weeks. Selecting and managing Affiliates Once authorized by their Institution, Authorized Investigators may then authorize staff, undergraduate or graduate students, or postdoctoral trainees to access Databrary as Affiliates. In granting a person Affiliate status, an Authorized Investigator takes responsibility for that person’s use of Databrary. An Authorized Investigator may grant a person outside their Institution Affiliate status if permitted by their Institution. If a person is eligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home Institution, that person should apply for access to Databrary through their home Institution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers eligible to be Authorized Investigators should not be granted access to Databrary as the Affiliate of another Authorized Investigator. Authorized Investigators are responsible for ensuring that Affiliates have human subjects and/or animal research training appropriate for the Institution and remain in good standing with the Institution. Affiliate access to an Authorized Investigator’s data Authorized Investigators determine which of the Authorized Investigator’s datasets an Affiliate has access to. Authorized Investigators can set each Affiliate’s access to one of the following levels: No access: Affiliate cannot access any of the Authorized Investigator’s data. This is the default. Read-only access: Affiliate has view access to all of the Authorized Investigator’s data. (The affiliate may view and download videos and other identifying information, including data that is not released for sharing.) Read/Write Access: Affiliate can access and edit all of the Authorized Investigator’s data. (The affiliate may view, download, add, change, and remove data as the Authorized Investigator without restriction.) Manager: Affiliate can access and change permissions on all of the Authorized Investigator’s data. (The Affiliate may additionally change the access controls and sharing levels of the Authorized Investigator’s data. Manager-level permission should be granted with utmost care.) These levels are analogous to granting an Affiliate different levels of access to the Authorized Investigator’s laboratory data server. Accordingly, the Investigator must trust Affiliates granted this access and supervise and manage Affiliates granted these privileges. The Authorized Investigator must assign an expiration date to each Affiliate’s access. Affiliate access to Databrary Affiliates can only gain access to data on Databrary that has been shared by other Authorized Investigators if specifically granted that access by their supervising Authorized Investigator. The Authorized Investigator must assign an expiration date to each Affiliate’s access. Many Authorized Investigators grant Affiliates access only to datasets the Authorized Investigator controls, not to other datasets shared on Databrary. Some Authorized Investigators grant access to datasets shared on Databrary to senior graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, or trusted research staff. Accessing data shared by others Authorized Investigators automatically have access to data on Databrary that has been shared by other Authorized Investigators. Affiliates only have access to shared data on Databrary only if granted that access by the Authorized Investigator who supervises them. Release levels In order to make it clear to participants and researchers what level of access should be granted to specific files, Databrary has developed a set of standard release levels. These levels are indicated with consistent icons and language across the site. The levels are as follows: Unknown. Consent missing or not obtained. This content is not shared and access is restricted to specific people selected by an Authorized Investigator. Private. This content is not shared and access is restricted to specific people selected by an Authorized Investigator. Note: This is the default for all files and must be specifically changed by an Authorized Investigator (or an Affiliate with suitable privileges). Authorized Users. This content is restricted to authorized Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted access to shared Databrary data) and may not be redistributed in any form. Learning Audiences. This content is restricted to authorized Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted access to shared Databrary data), who may use clips or images from it in presentations for informational or educational purposes. Note that such presentations may be videotaped or recorded and those videos or recordings may then be made available to the public via the internet (e.g., YouTube). Public. This content is available openly to anyone. All Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must follow the restrictions on uses indicated by these release levels. Furthermore, when using files released for access by Learning Audiences Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must exercise professional judgment in deciding what clips or images to show to what audiences and in what contexts. Non-research uses Many uses of Databrary do not constitute research, for example, browsing shared videos, downloading videos of displays or procedures, or showing excerpts in research or educational presentations. Authorized Investigators (and their Affiliates) must follow Institutional policies concerning whether specific non-research uses of Databrary require prior Institutional approval. Moreover, Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must always respect the release level associated with shared files. For example, data marked with an Authorized Users release level may only be viewed in research contexts (e.g., in the Authorized Investigator’s laboratory) by the Authorized Investigator or people under the supervision of the Authorized Investigator. Similarly, only those data with a release level of Learning Audiences or Public may be shown in research or educational presentations outside the Authorized Investigator’s laboratory. Research uses Authorized Investigators must secure Institutional approvals prior to conducting research with data shared on Databrary. In the U.S. context, conducting secondary analysis on shared video data may not qualify as human subjects research because there is no direct contact with research participants. Still, a research project involving video data reuse may require ethics board or IRB review and approval because the data are identifiable. Contributing new data Only Authorized Investigators may create new datasets, and only Authorized Investigators may share datasets with others. Non-sensitive/non-identifiable data or materials Authorized Investigators may upload to Databrary and share non-identifiable videos of research procedures, computer displays, research protocols, analysis code, or other research materials without any additional approvals, provided that sharing these elements with Databrary does not violate intellectual property rights of any person. De-identified or pseudonymized research data may be uploaded and shared subject to Institutional policies and approval. If an Authorized Investigator already has approval to share a de-identified or pseudonymized dataset with other researchers or with the public, then sharing that dataset on Databrary is permitted. All files uploaded to Databrary must be marked with a sharing release level. The default sharing release level is Private. While many non-sensitive/de-identified or pseudonymized data files could be made available to the public, it may be prudent to share de-identified or pseudonymized datasets only with Authorized Investigators. Identifiable or sensitive data Authorized Investigators must make preparations to share identifiable or sensitive data with Databrary. The next section describes some of these preparations. Securing Institutional approval Authorized Investigators must secure approval from their Institutions prior to sharing data with Databrary. Institutional approval usually involves research ethics board or IRB review or its equivalent. Approval to share data may be included in a new research protocol application or as an amendment to an existing protocol. For human subjects data, Databrary recommends adapting the Databrary Release Template although the exact Databrary Release Template language is not required. The Databrary Release Template serves as a guideline. The Institutional research ethics board or IRB must determine what specific language should be used for securing data sharing permission and whether requesting permission to share data should be part of the research consent process or separate from it. It is essential that whatever language and permission process the Institution requires enables the Authorized Investigator to determine clearly what level of sharing release participants have granted. Authorized Investigators must be able to assign a sharing release level to each file uploaded to Databrary that reflects the sharing permission granted by the research participant. In some cases, research ethics boards and IRBs have deemed that certain release language in research consent forms from previously collected data permits sharing in Databrary. This has made archival data collected prior to the creation of Databrary to be stored and shared in the library. If an Authorized Investigator has archival data, Databrary staff are happy to discuss whether and how these might be stored and shared on the system. Removing data destruction clauses There are often misconceptions about regulations pertaining to data destruction, especially where video or audio recordings are concerned. In the U.S., NIH and NSF do not require data destruction. Data destruction clauses inherently conflict with the ability to store and share data indefinitely via repositories like Databrary. Rather than promising to destroy data after some time period in a research protocol, Databrary recommends the following language: “Data will be stored for an indefinite period in a restricted data library on the internet (databrary.org).” Obtaining participant release for sharing Once research protocol approval has been granted, Authorized Investigators may start securing permission from participants and recording those permissions. Authorized Investigators must ensure that the process used for obtaining participant release for sharing meets relevant regulatory requirements, e.g. GDPR. Why ask Video and audio recordings of participants are inherently identifiable. In order to share identifiable data on Databrary Authorized Investigators must secure permission from the people depicted in recordings or images. Authorized Investigators can share identifiable research recordings (or other identifiable data elements like birth dates) only when the Authorized Investigators (a) get approval from their Institutions to do so, (b) inform participants about what sharing these data elements means, and (c) secure participants’ permission to share. Databrary calls this data sharing permission a “release” since it involves releasing data for use by other researchers. When to ask Databrary recommends that Authorized Investigators ask participants for permission to share at the end of data collection after participants have acquired first-hand knowledge about the study procedures. This ensures that consent to participate is completely separate from permission to share and the risk that asking participants about sharing their data will affect their decision about whether or not to participate in research. However, some Institutions may prefer to have Authorized Investigators incorporate data sharing permission into the research consent process or even to have data sharing permission be part of an entirely separate protocol. The important and essential point is to secure sharing permission and record it faithfully. How to ask To standardize the process of obtaining data sharing releases from participants—and make it as simple as possible for researchers—Databrary has developed the Databrary Release Template. The template can be added to or incorporated within human subjects research ethics protocols. The Databrary Release Template was developed and refined in close consultation with the IRB office at NYU. It gives researchers a standardized way to obtain the necessary permissions to share data in Databrary. The template makes it clear and unambiguous to participants about what agreeing to share data in Databrary will mean. Uploading to Databrary What to upload In addition to video, Databrary can store many types of data and supplemental files associated with a research project. These can be images, graphs, stimuli, protocols, blank questionnaires, analysis code, and consent or release documents. Databrary permits Authorized Investigators to store any information permitted by the Institution. However, some information poses greater risks to participants than others, and these should be stored on Databrary only after special consideration. For example, first or last names, home location information more specific than state, and contact information are generally considered high risk for the disclosure of participants’ identities. These data items should not be uploaded to Databrary. Video and audio recordings may be uploaded to Databrary if the Authorized Investigator has secured participant (or parent) permission and the Institution approves. Under some circumstances, an Institution may determine that participant (or parent) permission is not necessary to store video and audio recordings on Databrary. For example, regarding recordings collected a long time in the past, participant (or parent) permission may be unavailable, and the Institution may determine that the risk to participants is low. Or, an Authorized Investigator may choose to store video and audio recordings on Databrary for sharing only among collaborators and Affiliates specifically chosen by the Authorized Investigator, but have no plans to share the videos with the broader Databrary community. This use of Databrary is permitted, but discouraged, as the purpose of Databrary is to foster data sharing beyond an individual research project or group. Exact birth dates or test dates may also be considered identifiable data elements. However, these dates can be highly valuable for future research uses, and may pose a lower level of risk to participants than some other data elements. Accordingly, Databrary permits the storage of exact dates, but treats exact dates with special care. The system only exposes exact dates to Authorized Investigators or their Affiliates who upload the data, and only exposes exact dates in shared datasets if the participant has agreed to share data (grant sharing release at the Authorized User level or above). Other low risk data items like race, ethnicity, gender, and related personal characteristics may be stored on Databrary without specific permission. Assignment of sharing release level The only essential item of information required for uploading files to Databrary is the sharing release level. Authorized Investigators are responsible for recording participant sharing release permissions and assigning them to files uploaded to Databrary. Databrary assigns all files a default release level of Private, so an Authorized Investigator must change the default Private release setting in order to share a file with people other than an Authorized Investigator’s Affiliates or Authorized Investigators who are research collaborators on a specific dataset. Who may upload Authorized Investigators may upload data, and Authorized Investigators determine who among their Affiliates may also upload data to Databrary. When to upload Authorized Investigators need not wait until a research project ends to upload data to Databrary. Authorized Investigators may upload files to Databrary as soon as possible after a data collection. This is called active curation. It distributes the time required to curate a dataset for sharing and thereby reduces the overall burden of data sharing. Non-human animal data We are developing guidance for the use of Databrary to store non-human animal data. Sharing data Authorized Investigators determine when data stored on Databrary are ready to be shared with the broader community of Databrary Authorized Investigators. Typical ‘triggers’ for sharing a data collection are when a paper goes out for review or goes to press, when a grant report is prepared, or when a grant period ends. To share a dataset, the Authorized Investigator simply changes the access level on that dataset. This makes metadata about all data and materials visible so that other Authorized Investigators can access them, subject to the sharing release levels indicated for each file. Datasets receive a persistent identifier (DOI) when shared. Authorized Investigators may “unshare” a dataset, but except under unusual circumstances, this is not considered best practice. Removing or altering participant data Research participants in the European Economic Area (EEA) have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) pertaining to the use, sharing, and removal of their personal data. Since Databrary does not typically store information that maps personal identities to the data stored on Databrary without a separate agreement, Authorized Investigators and Institutions are responsible for responding to any requests to provide copies of, change, restrict access to, or delete a participants’ personal data stored on Databrary. Databrary cannot guarantee that personal data previously shared on Databrary can be retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who have accessed the data. Thus, in seeking permission from research participants to share personal data via Databrary, Authorized Investigators should communicate that there are limits to a participant’s right to modify or delete personal data previously shared on Databrary. Changing institutions Authorized Investigators who change Institutions must notify Databrary of the change and its effective date. As soon as possible, the Authorized Investigator must secure authorization from their new Institution. Authorized Investigators who are awaiting authorization from their new Institution will have access to their own data but not to non-public data shared by other Authorized Investigators on Databrary. Once an Authorized Investigator has secured approval from the new Institution, full access privileges will be restored.
