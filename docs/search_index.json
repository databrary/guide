[["ethics.html", "Chapter 2 Ethics Ethics/IRB Review Permission to share Sharing release levels Sharing data collected without a Databrary-specific release", " Chapter 2 Ethics Databrary strives to uphold the highest research ethics while maximizing open and secure access to research data. We achieve this through multiple means: Requiring that researchers fulfill all institutional requirements, including ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) review if needed, in order to use Databrary materials. Providing researchers with template language that may be used to apply for and secure ethics board approval. Requiring researchers to ask research participants for their permission to share data and providing template language to guide the process. We also provide a template for securing sharing permission from research staff that are recorded. Providing a sample participant data sharing release script and example videos of the data sharing release process. Sample Email requesting data sharing release when it is not possible to obtain permission at the time of the visit Developing consistent terminology and visual icons for documenting sharing release levels. Providing guidance about when and how data collected previously might be stored and shared on Databrary. Ethics/IRB Review IRB Application Template Language Permission to share Sharing release template forms for download Data sharing release templates for Participants and Lab Staff. Sample Script for requesting permission to share Now that you have finished this session, there’s one more thing we want to ask you. The data that researchers collect from babies and families are incredibly valuable for helping scientists to understand how children develop. So we wanted to ask if you are comfortable with allowing us to share the data we collected from this session with other researchers just like the professor who runs this lab/project. The data would be shared in a secure, online library, it’s not available to the public– only researchers that are authorized by their University would be able to access the information in the library. This permission form also asks whether you would allow other professors/ researchers like Dr. [PI’s Name] to show short bits of the videos to students or researchers for educational and scientific purposes. These data will not be used or shown for commercial purposes.
