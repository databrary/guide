## I downloaded files from Databrary, but the filenames are truncated.

When Databrary downloads files there is a `32 character filename limit`. Please ensure the file names do not exceed this. 

If the file name is too long (the first 32 characters of the filename are exactly the same), it is impossible to distinguish between these files when they download and only __one__ file will be downloaded.
