## I downloaded files from Databrary, but the filenames are truncated.

When Databrary downloads files there is a `32 character filename limit`. Please ensure the file names do not exceed this. If they are too long, it may not be able to distinguish between multiple files and it will appear that only 1 file was downloaded.
