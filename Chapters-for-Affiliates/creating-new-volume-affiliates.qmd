# Create a new volume {.unnumbered}
Each project can create a volume for storing and sharing data. We encourage corresponding actions to be performed before the project is in collecting data process. In this case, you would utilize the upload as you go method of data curation. 

We have intentionally limited the permissions to manage the volume to ensure data security. Creating volumes is a privilege granted to the project's **Manager** status affiliates, and sharing the volume is **not** allowed for affiliates.

**Volumes cannot be deleted once created.** 
:::

If you have created a volume by mistake, you can hide the volume by restricting access to others or rename the volume so that it can be reused by another future project. 




## Step 1: Login/Go to Profile 
Let's get started with creating a new volume.

Review [Onborading-affiliates](../Chapters-for-Affiliates/onboarding-affiliates.qmd) for how to find your profile.

## Step 2: Look for Create a new volume button

If the button is not available, check your sponsor status by reviewing your profile.
If you are not granted with **Manager** status, you will not be able to create a new volume.

![Affiliates with Read-only Access](../Chapters-for-Affiliates/img/db-profile-sponsor.png){#profile-sponsor}

Read-Only access will not allow you to create a new volume. Only affiliates granted with **Manager** status will be able to create a new volume. Meanwhile, affiliates at all circumstances may not share access to the volume with others even with the manager status.

If you have been granted with access to create a new volume, you will see the button `Create a new volume` under **Your Sponsor Volumes**.

Again, creating a new volume with careful consideration is important. Once created, the volume **cannot** be deleted.
