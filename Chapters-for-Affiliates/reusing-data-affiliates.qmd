Sometimes the data is too large to download as a single file. Databrary would take a while to prepare the data for download. If you encountered downloading issues, you can try download the data in smaller chunks. You can download a single session by clicking the `Download` button on the session profile page. Just double-click the file name.

2. The `Download` button will download the data in a format that is compatible with the Databrary platform.

When a file is compressed by Databrary, the name of the file with be prepended with the pathway to find the file. If the file is intened to be used for further analysis, it is important to rename the file to a more descriptive name. The adapted name may interupt data mining such as the file name `session1` may be renamed to `001-session1`. In this case, consider downloading the original data to avoid from renaming massive files.
