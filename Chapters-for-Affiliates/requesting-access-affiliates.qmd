# Requesting access as affiliates

**Each Databrary user must have their own login and password.**

## Requesting authorization 

Every Databrary user who seeks access to restricted data **must** request and be granted authorization for that access. As a restricted access data library, Databrary need to make sure that users are empowered to follow the guidelines for accessing the data. 

Remember, **Authorized Investigators** must secure authorization from an **institution**;
**Affiliate** must secure authorization from an **Authorized Investigator**!

Please read the requirements for Affiliates. Choose the radio button that accurately reflects your qualifications. If you are not certain with you status, review [Determine Rsearchers Status](determine-status.qmd).

::: {.callout-tip} 
It's time for you to contact your supervisor (**Authorized Investigators**) for authorization. You will need authorization for further storing, sharing, or resuing data.
You may also set up your Databrary profile while authorization is pending. 
:::

## Awaiting authorization 

The process of securing authorization can take a few hours, or a few days or weeks.
Institutions that have many active Databrary users are familiar with the system and **usually** process authorization requests quickly.

The Databrary staff will work closely with you to expedite your authorization.

Once authorized, you will receive an email confirmation.
