You can check out your **Volumes, Sponsors, and Affilliates status** if you click the `Dashboard`.

## Tour of Databrary Dashboard 
The dashboard contains two major parts: volumes and affiliations. 

On the left side, you can view volumes that you own or shared access to. For affiliations, it is likely that your sponsors may share their projects access with you. You can check your accessibility by putting your mouse over the `lock` ion.

On your right side, you can see your sponsor(s). Affiliates may not share their access to other affiliates.

To make changes in your account informations, click the pen-shaped `edit` button.
