# Completed Project {.unnumbered}

The following items need to be considered to prepare for upload:

- Do you have (at least some of) participants’ permission to share their data with other authorized Databrary investigators? If not, who is allowed access to the videos?
- Do you have IRB permission to share the data on Databrary?
- All video tapes need to be digitized
- How are the data organized? Will these need to be re-organized to utilize the Databrary Spreadsheet structure?
