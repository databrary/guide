# Authorized Researchers {.unnumbered}

## Eligibility {-}

Databrary policies and your home *institution* determine whether you are eligible to be granted access to Databrary as an *Authorized Investigator*.
Here are some factors that contribute to that determination:

- I conduct independent, unsupervised, research at my institution;
- I submit funding proposals as lead investigator;
- I have Principal Investigator (PI) status or hold a tenure-track faculty position at my institution;
- My institution maintains or uses an ethics board to review and approve research involving human subjects (or non-human animals where relevant); 
- I have current training that addresses research ethics with human subject (e.g. [CITI](https://about.citiprogram.org/) training);
- I would like to reuse or upload data to Databrary.
- I sponsor and supervise lab staff and students who work on my projects or on collaborative projects, and I  have authority to supervise their access to data that I share or or others have shared on Databrary.

## Seeking Authorization {-}

If these factors apply to you, you must [register](https://nyu.databrary.org/user/register) on Databrary, request authorization from your institution, and secure authorization.

Registration involves creating an account, setting a password, and confirming your account.
Requesting authorization involves securing approval from an official at your institution by means of formal signatures on the [Databrary Access Agreement (DAA)](../appendices/access_agreement.qmd) and its Annexes.

If you know who at your institution reviews, approves, and signs data access agreements or other contracts, that is probably the person who will need to sign the DAA.
You also may need to sign it.
If you don't know the person at your institution, Databrary staff will help identify the right person.
Databrary will work with you and your institution to secure signatures on the DAA.
