# Databrary 2.0 {.unnumbered}

## About {-}

This page describes the most important changes in Databrary 2.0, launched in early March 2025.

## Logging in {-}

Like Databrary 1.0, you may log in via the orange Login button or the login button on the application menu bar.

Databrary 2.0 supports two-factor authentication (2FA).
When you log in with your password, the system will send an email to the account associated with Databrary with a one-time password (OTP).
Enter this password in the 2FA window.

::: {.callout-note}
In the very near future Databrary 2.0 will support 2FA via text message.

Check your spam/junk filter if you do not see the email shortly after you log in.

## Logging out {-}

Databrary 2.0 has a large Logout button to the right of the logged-in user's name.

## Previewing files {-}

You may preview and play video and audio files Databrary 2.0.

Databrary 2.0 adds the ability to preview new file types, including PDF, and csv.

## Volume ownership {-}

Databrary 2.0 requires that volumes have a *single* owner.
Only the owner can change the sharing status of a volume.
Volume owners must be Authorized Investigators at an institution with an active Databrary Access Agreement.
Volume owners may transfer ownership to another Authorized Investigator.

::: {.callout-note}
To simplify the migration to Databrary 2.0, we selected a single volume owner where there were multiple owners (Investigators).
If the volume owner wishes to transfer ownership, that person may do so.
:::

To transfer ownership to another Authorized Investigator:

1. Visit the volume in question.

2. Press the edit (pencil) icon in the volume banner.

3. Open the Manage Access panel at left by clicking on the tab.

4. Under the Owner section, press on the Transfer Ownership button.

5. Search for the new volume owner by typing in the search box.

6. Select the new owner from the list and press the Submit button at lower right.

![](include/img/select-new-owner.png){#fig-select-new-owner}

The individual you select will receive a notification that you have requested to transfer ownership to them.
They may accept or reject the request.

## Managing people {-}

Databrary 2.0 separates the management of co-authors who should get scholarly credit from people who have access to a volume.

## Roadmap {-}

::: {.callout-warning}
Databrary 2.0 does *not* permit file uploads and search is disabled.
We made this very painful choice in order to give users access to data that had been offline for a long time.
These features are under development and will be added soon.

We expect to be releasing new minor versions of Databrary with patches and bug fixes on a regular basis over the next several months.

And Databrary has received new [funding from NSF](https://databrary.github.io/nsf-2444730) to support even more feature enhancements over the next two years.
:::

### 2.1 (expected end of March)

- File uploads
- Search
- User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) enhancements
