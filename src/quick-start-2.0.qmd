# Databrary 2.0 {.unnumbered}

## About {-}

This page describes the most important changes in Databrary 2.0, launched in early March 2025.

## Logging in {-}

Like Databrary 1.0, you may log in via the orange Login button or the login button on the application menu bar.

Databrary 2.0 supports two-factor authentication (2FA).
When you log in with your password, the system will send an email to the account associated with Databrary with a one-time password (OTP).
Enter this password in the 2FA window.

::: {.callout-note}
In the very near future Databrary 2.0 will support 2FA via text message.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
Check your spam/junk filter if you do not see the email shortly after you log in.

The email will come from "help@databrary.org" with "Databrary OTP" as the subject.
:::

## Logging out {-}

Databrary 2.0 has a large Logout button to the right of the logged-in user's name.

![Logout button in application menu bar.](include/img/logout-button.png){width=50% #fig-logout-button}

::: {.callout-important}
## Logging out

It is a good practice to log out when you are finished working with Databrary.
:::

## Accessing your volumes

Click on your name in the menu bar to navigate to your (private) profile page.

![Link to user profile on Databrary menu bar.](include/img/access-user-profile.png){width="50%" #fig-access-user-profile}

You will see a view like this:

![A portion of Rick Gilmore's private profile page.](include/img/gilmore-private-profile.png){#fig-gilmore-private-profile}

You will see a list of all volumes you have access to on the left, your sponsors (institutions or individual researchers) in the upper right, and your affiliates in the lower right.

To search for a specific volume, click on the arrow/stacked-bar icon to the right of the "Name" in the volume table. This will bring up a search window that you can use to find or filter volumes.

![Search by volume name window.](include/img/user-profile-select-volume.png){#fig-user-profile-select-volume width="50%"}

You may also search for volumes by owner by clicking on the same icon in the "Owner" column (not shown).

<!-- To sort by Volume Sharing Level or User Access Level, click on the icons in those columns of the table. -->

To expand the number of volume entries shown in the table, click on the number to the right of the "Page Size" label at the bottom of the volume table.

![Expanding the number of visible entries in the volume table.](include/img/expand-n-volume-table-entries.png){#fig-expand-n-volume-table-entries width="50%"}

To view a volume, click on the volume name.

## Volume ownership {-}

Databrary 2.0 requires that volumes have a *single* owner.
Only the owner can change the sharing status of a volume.
Volume owners must be [Authorized Investigators](more-information/definitions.qmd#authorized-investigator) at an institution with an active [Databrary Access Agreement](appendices/access_agreement.qmd).
Volume owners may only transfer ownership to another Authorized Investigator.

::: {.callout-note}
## Only one volume owner permitted
To simplify the migration to Databrary 2.0, we selected a single volume owner where there were multiple owners (Investigators).
If the volume owner wishes to transfer ownership, that person may do so.
:::

To transfer ownership to another Authorized Investigator:

1. Visit the volume in question.

2. Press the edit (pencil) icon in the volume banner.

![Volume-level controls.](include/img/edit-volume.png){width=50% #fig-edit-volume}

3. Open the Manage Access panel at left by clicking on the tab.

![Manage volume access.](include/img/manage-access-tab.png){width=50% #fig-manage-access}

4. Under the Owner section, press on the Transfer Ownership button.

![Transfer volume ownership.](include/img/transfer-ownership.png){#fig-transfer-ownership}

5. Search for the new volume owner by typing in the search box.

![Search for new volume owner](include/img/transfer-ownership-search.png){#fig-transfer-ownership-search}

6. Select the new owner from the list and press the Submit button at lower right.

![](include/img/select-new-owner.png){#fig-select-new-owner}

The individual you select will receive a notification that you have requested to transfer ownership to them.
They may accept or reject the request.


## Uploading files

::: {.callout-warning}
## File uploads temporarily disabled
The initial release of Databrary 2.0 does *not* permit file uploads and search is disabled.
We made this very painful choice in order to give users access to data that had been offline for a long time.
These features are under development and will be added *very* soon.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Text entry permitted, but in beta
Users may create volumes and create spreadsheets for volumes.

Text entry into spreadsheets (no file uploads) works, but is still undergoing testing.
:::

## Previewing files {-}

You may preview and play video and audio files Databrary 2.0.

Databrary 2.0 adds the ability to preview new file types, including PDF, and csv.

::: {.callout-warning}
## Under construction

This section is a work-in-progress.
:::

## Downloading files

You may download files in Databrary 2.0.

## Managing people {-}

Databrary 2.0 separates the management of co-authors who should get scholarly credit from people who have access to a volume.

### Managing co-authors {-}

## Roadmap {-}

::: {.callout-warning}
Databrary 2.0 does *not* permit file uploads and search is disabled.
We made this very painful choice in order to give users access to data that had been offline for a long time.
These features are under development and will be added soon.

We expect to be releasing new minor versions of Databrary with patches and bug fixes on a regular basis over the next several months.

And Databrary has received new [funding from NSF](https://databrary.github.io/nsf-2444730) to support even more feature enhancements over the next two years.
:::

### 2.1 (expected end of March)

- File uploads
- Search
- User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) enhancements
