# Databrary 2.0 {.unnumbered}

## About {-}

This page describes the most important changes in Databrary 2.0, launched in early March 2025.

## Logging in {-}

Like Databrary 1.0, you may log in via the orange Login button or the login button on the application menu bar.

Databrary 2.0 supports two-factor authentication (2FA).
When you log in with your password, the system will send an email to the account associated with Databrary with a one-time password (OTP).
Enter this password in the 2FA window.

::: {.callout-note}
In the very near future Databrary 2.0 will support 2FA via text message.
:::

![Two-factor authentication window in Databrary 2.0.](include/img/2FA-window.png){width=50% #fig-2FA-window}

::: {.callout-important}
Check your spam/junk filter if you do not see the email shortly after you log in.

The email will come from "help@databrary.org" with "Databrary OTP" as the subject.
:::

## Logging out {-}

Databrary 2.0 has a large Logout button to the right of the logged-in user's name.

![Logout button in application menu bar.](include/img/logout-button.png){width=50% #fig-logout-button}

::: {.callout-important}
## Logging out

It is a good practice to log out when you are finished working with Databrary.
:::

## Accessing your volumes

Click on your name in the menu bar to navigate to your (private) profile page.

![Link to user profile on Databrary menu bar.](include/img/access-user-profile.png){width="50%" #fig-access-user-profile}

You will see a view like this:

![A portion of Rick Gilmore's private profile page.](include/img/gilmore-private-profile.png){#fig-gilmore-private-profile}

You will see a list of all volumes you have access to on the left, your sponsors (institutions or individual researchers) in the upper right, and your affiliates in the lower right.

To search for a specific volume, click on the arrow/stacked-bar icon to the right of the "Name" in the volume table. This will bring up a search window that you can use to find or filter volumes.

![Search by volume name window.](include/img/user-profile-select-volume.png){#fig-user-profile-select-volume width="50%"}

You may also search for volumes by owner by clicking on the same icon in the "Owner" column (not shown).

<!-- To sort by Volume Sharing Level or User Access Level, click on the icons in those columns of the table. -->

To expand the number of volume entries shown in the table, click on the number to the right of the "Page Size" label at the bottom of the volume table.

![Expanding the number of visible entries in the volume table.](include/img/expand-n-volume-table-entries.png){#fig-expand-n-volume-table-entries width="50%"}

To view a volume, click on the volume name.

![Select a volume from Volume table in the private user profile.](include/img/select-volume-user-profile.png){#fig-select-volume-user-profile}



## Volume ownership {-}

Databrary 2.0 requires that volumes have a *single* owner.
Only the owner can change the sharing status of a volume.
Volume owners must be [Authorized Investigators](more-information/definitions.qmd#authorized-investigator) at an institution with an active [Databrary Access Agreement](appendices/access_agreement.qmd).
Volume owners may only transfer ownership to another Authorized Investigator.

::: {.callout-note}
## Only one volume owner permitted
To simplify the migration to Databrary 2.0, we selected a single volume owner where there were multiple owners (Investigators).
If the volume owner wishes to transfer ownership, that person may do so.
:::

To transfer ownership to another Authorized Investigator:

1. Visit the volume in question.

2. Press the edit (pencil) icon in the volume banner.

![Volume-level controls.](include/img/edit-volume.png){width=50% #fig-edit-volume}

3. Open the Manage Access panel at left by clicking on the tab.

![Manage volume access.](include/img/manage-access-tab.png){width=50% #fig-manage-access}

4. Under the Owner section, press on the Transfer Ownership button.

![Transfer volume ownership.](include/img/transfer-ownership.png){#fig-transfer-ownership}

5. Search for the new volume owner by typing in the search box.

![Search for new volume owner](include/img/transfer-ownership-search.png){#fig-transfer-ownership-search}

6. Select the new owner from the list and press the Submit button at lower right.

![](include/img/select-new-owner.png){#fig-select-new-owner}

The individual you select will receive a notification that you have requested to transfer ownership to them.
They may accept or reject the request.


## Uploading files

::: {.callout-warning}
## File uploads temporarily disabled
The initial release of Databrary 2.0 does *not* permit file uploads and search is disabled.
We made this very painful choice in order to give users access to data that had been offline for a long time.
These features are under development and will be added *very* soon.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Text entry permitted, but undergoing beta-testing
Users may create volumes and create spreadsheets for volumes.

Text entry into spreadsheets (no file uploads) works, but is still undergoing testing.
:::

## Previewing files {-}

You may preview and play video and audio files in Databrary 2.0.

Databrary 2.0 adds the ability to preview new file types, including csv and (coming soon!) PDF.

## Downloading files

You may download files in Databrary 2.0 under the following conditions:

1. The [entire volume is shared](more-information/definitions.qmd#entire-volume-shared) AND the files have a [Public sharing release level](more-information/definitions.qmd#public) (![](../include/img/public.svg){.icon}).\
2. The [entire volume is shared](more-information/definitions.qmd#entire-volume-shared) AND the files are shared with a [Learning Audiences](more-information/definitions.qmd#learning-audiences) (![](../include/img/excerpts.svg){.icon}) or [Authorized User](more-information/definitions.qmd#authorized-users) (![](../include/img/shared.svg){.icon}) sharing release level, AND you have privileges to access shared data on Databrary.\
2. The volume is [Private](more-information/definitions.qmd#private-volume) (shared only with specific collaborators), the files are shared with *any* permission level, AND you have read privileges on the volume.

::: {.callout-warning}
## Session and Volume Zip-archive generation disabled for users not logged in

If you are an authorized user on Databrary but are *not* logged in, you may not create or download a zip archive.
Members of the public who are not authorized users are also prohibited from creating and downloading zip archives.
:::

### Single files

As an example, let's download a file from Volume 1 which is visible to the public.

1. We navigate to <https://databrary.org/volume/1>.
2. We scroll to the Materials section and select the folder labeled "Top-level Materials."
3. Click on the "View Details" icon (box with arrow pointing upper right).

![Volume 1 Materials](include/img/select-volume-1-top-level-materials.png){#fig-select-volume-1-top-level-materials}

4. When the folder window opens, click on the download icon (down arrow) and select Download from the menu.

![Download counting video from Volume 1 materials folder.](include/img/download-volume-1-counting-video.png){#fig-download-volume-1-video.png}

The short "counting_demo_video.mp4" file will download to the default download location for your browser. 
Depending on your configuration, the file may also automatically load for playback.

### Zip archives

Logged-in users may generate a zip archive of a session or a volume.

Navigate to the main page for volume 1 (<https://databrary.org/volume/1>) and the volume materials section at the bottom (see @fig-select-volume-1-top-level-materials).

To download the entire materials session, select "Top-level materials" and click on the "Download Options" icon (down arrow; magenta box in @fig-generate-zip-volume-1-materials).

To download the entire volume, click on the "Download all as ZIP" button (cyan box in @fig-generate-zip-volume-1-materials).

![Download zip archives of Volume 1 materials or entire volume.](include/img/generate-zip-volume-1-materials.png){#fig-generate-zip-volume-1-materials}

A notification window will appear in the bottom of your browser.

![Zip archive notification window.](include/img/download-preparing-modal.png){#fig-download-preparing-modal width="80%"}

You will receive an email from "help@databrary.org" when your archive is ready to download.

![Email notification about zip archive](include/img/zip-archive-download-email.png){#fig-zip-archive-download-email}

## Managing access on volumes {-}

Databrary 2.0 separates the management of co-authors who should get scholarly credit from people who have access to a volume.

### Managing co-authors {-}

::: {.callout-important}
## Only the volume owner can edit
In Databrary 2.0, only [the volume owner](quick-start-2.0.qmd#volume-ownership) can edit co-authors.
:::

1. Visit a volume that you own.\
2. Click on the edit (pencil) icon.

![Edit button for Volume 1 (owned by Rick Gilmore)](include/img/volume-1-header-edit.png){#fig-volume-1-header-edit width="80%"}

3. To edit the order of authors, visit the Overview panel.

![Edit overview for a volume](include/img/volume-1-edit-overview.png){#fig-volume-1-edit-overview width="40%"}

4. Scroll down to the Reorder Citation section. Click on the author you wish to reposition to change the author order.

![Citation Preview for Volume 1](include/img/volume-1-citation-previews.png){#fig-volume-1-citation-previews}

When you change the author order, the the window will show you how the author order(s) have changed.

![Reordered citation author order](include/img/volume-1-citation-reorder-citation.png){#fig-volume-1-citation-reorder-citation}

5. Scroll back up to the top of the Overview panel and hit Save to save the change.

![Save changed author order](include/img/save-changed-author-order.png){#fig-save-changed-author-order}

### Managing collaborators 

::: {.callout-warning}
## Under construction

This section is a work-in-progress.
:::


## Roadmap {-}

::: {.callout-warning}
Databrary 2.0 does *not* permit file uploads and search is disabled.
We made this very painful choice in order to give users access to data that had been offline for a long time.
These features are under development and will be added soon.

We expect to be releasing new minor versions of Databrary with patches and bug fixes on a regular basis over the next several months.

And Databrary has received new [funding from NSF](https://databrary.github.io/nsf-2444730) to support even more feature enhancements over the next two years.
:::

### 2.1 (expected end of March)

- File uploads
- Search
- User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) enhancements
