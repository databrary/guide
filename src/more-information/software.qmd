# Software {.unnumbered}

This page describes some useful information about Databrary's software.

## Databrary 1.0

The Databrary application runs on a virtual machine running CentOS managed by NYU IT.
Automatic transcoding of all uploaded video and audio files is handled by NYU's High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.
Data is stored in Isilon arrays that are managed by the NYU Libraries.

### Frontend

- AngularJS 1.4
- Coffee Script 1.7.1
- JQuery 1.12.3
- Stylus 0.54.5 + nib 1.1.2

### Backend

- GHC 8.0.2
- Haskell 2010
- Solr 6.6
- PostgreSQL 9.5
- FFmpeg 4.2.4

### Application

Datasets are organized into separate [*volumes*](references.qmd#volume) with system-wide unique (integer) identifiers. 
Groups of data files related to a specific person or people (or non-human animal), a date, time, and location are grouped into [*sessions*](references.qmd#session) ([*slots*](references.qmd#slot)) within a volume. 
Individual files ([*assets*](definitions.qmd#asset)) of varying types are organized within a session (slot). Sessions (slots) and files (assets) are assigned system-wide unique (integer) identifiers.

Individual users and institutions (called *parties*) are assigned system-wide unique identifiers and have some overlapping data elements (e.g., prename, sortname). 
Access privileges are granted hierarchically in a parent/child organization. 
For example, Databrary is the parent of New York University (NYU); NYU is the parent of Karen Adolph and multiple other *Authorized Investigators*; Karen Adolph is the parent of multiple Affiliate investigators who have broad access to volumes Dr. Adolph has created. 
Further details about how *Authorized Investigators* assign access permission to *Affiliates* can be found in the [System Roles](software.qmd#system-roles) section below.

### Sharing Release Levels

Restricted data and metadata are controlled by a specific set of [sharing release levels](https://databrary.org/support/irb/release-levels.html).
These levels apply at the session/slot and file/asset level. 
Newly uploaded files default to *Private*. 
The [terminology](definitions.qmd) associated with these levels, the icons used to identify the levels, and the level of user access permitted by the levels are deeply embedded in the Databrary policy framework.

- ![](https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/unknown.svg){.icon} : *Unknown*
- ![](https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/private.svg){.icon} : *Private*
- ![](https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/shared.svg){.icon} : *Shared* 
- ![](https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/excerpts.svg){.icon} : *Learning Audiences*
- ![](https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/public.svg){.icon} : *Public* 

### API

All Databrary frontend calls use the API. The volume/slot/asset identifier scheme described previously supports API calls of the following form:

https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1/slot/9807?asset=9200

This call accesses the Databrary “leaf” logo in volume 1, slot (session) 9807, with asset ID 9200. Similarly, https://nyu.databrary.org/party/12 returns information about all of the *Authorized Investigators* who are authorized through party 12, The Pennsylvania State University.

Most, but not all of the Databrary API is [documented](https://github.com/databrary/route-doc). 
If it is necessary to change the API calls in the rewrite, then the API should be versioned, and the new system should support current API calls.

### Backend Services

All audio and video files uploaded automatically generate transcoding jobs that are handled by the NYU HPC.

The system mints a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) when a volume is shared. 
This must continue. Databrary piggybacks on the DOI account controlled by NYU Libraries. 

The system generates and updates standard bibliographic citations for a volume based on volume data and metadata.

### System roles

#### Super user

The system supports a small number of *Super User* accounts. 
Only an existing *Super User* can grant *Super User* privileges to another account holder. 
*Super User* have the following privileges:

- Editing user (party) account information
- Changing a user’s parent (sponsor) and child (affiliate) links
- Granting or removing system-wide access privileges
- Resetting user passwords
- Monitoring and managing the health of the system as a whole, including restarting stalled video transcoding jobs via an admin dashboard
- Generating email related to the process for requesting authorization from an institution for specific users

#### User

The system supports user accounts with the following features and privileges:

- Account creation
- Requesting authorization from an institution or individual (party)
- Editing user profile information (ORCID, web site, social media, additional email accounts, department)
- Two tiers of access: [*Authorized Investigators*](definitions.qmd#authorized-investigator) and [*Affiliates*](definitions.qmd#affiliate).^[*Affiliates* will be replaced by new term: *Sponsored Researchers* in Databrary 2.0].
  - *Authorized Investigators* are specifically linked to an authorizing institution (party) when the Super User establishes that link. *Authorized Investigators* can:
    - Create, edit, share, and unshare volumes
    - Create, edit, and delete sessions (slots) in volumes they own or co-own
    - Upload, download, modify, and delete files (assets) in sessions in volumes they own or co-own
    - Modify which other users (*Authorized Investigators* or *Affiliates*) have access to a volume, session (slot), or file (asset); this includes removing access.
    - With regard to *Affiliate*, *Authorized Investigator*s determine:
      - The *Affiliate*'s level of access to all of Databrary (no access or full access to shared data)
      - The *Affiliate*’s level of access to the *Authorized Investigator*’s data (no access; read-only access; read/write access; manager access)
    - Modify the level (sharing release level) assigned to a session (slot) or file (asset)
  - *Affiliates* privileges to access restricted data on Databrary are specifically linked to one or more *Authorized Investigator*s. The *Authorized Investigator* controls that link. Links should expire on a regular (timed) basis. When linked to an *Authorized Investigator*, *Affiliate*s have the level of access granted by that *Authorized Investigator* to i) Databrary as a whole (default is none) and ii) to specific volumes owned by the *Authorized Investigator*.
  
### Volume Sharing Levels

- See [more-information/definitions](definitions.qmd#volume-sharing-levels).
- ![](https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/volume-access-shared.svg){.icon}: *Private* (to research collaborators): 
- ![](https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/partial.svg){.icon}: *Volume Overview* 
- ![](https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/public.svg){.icon}: *Entire Volume Shared* (with the public)

An *Authorized Investigator* has a private page that combines personal profile information and a dashboard with information about volumes, sponsors, and affiliates.

![Rick Gilmore's *private* profile and dashboard.](../include/img/db-gilmore-private-profile-dashboard.png)

The Dashboard consists of two columns.
The left column provides information about *Volumes* the *Authorized Investigator* has created or has access to.

The following figure illustrates that the Volume has "Entire Volume Shared" status (unlocked lock icon; "Share Entire Volume" tooltip).

![](../include/img/db-gilmore-dashboard-shared-vol.png)
Also, on this *Volume*, the user has "Investigator" status, meaning that the data can be fully edited and shared with others, as indicated by the tooltip and the crown icon):

![](../include/img/db-gilmore-dashboard-shared-read-write-share.png)

Some volumes are *Private* (locked lock icon), accessible only to the researcher and specific *Affiliates* (network icon).

![](../include/img/db-gilmore-dashboard-private-vol-affiliates-access.png)

![](../include/img/db-gilmore-dashboard-private-vol-show-group-affiliates.png)

This user also has volumes with *Volume Overview Shared* as indicated by the keyhole icon:

![](../include/img/db-gilmore-dashboard-volume-overview.png)

Some other *Authorized Investigators* have also given this user read-write (pencil icon) status to their volumes that have *Volume Overview Shared* status:

![](../include/img/db-gilmore-dashboard-volume-overview-read-write.png)

And still other *Authorized Investigators* have given this user read-only (eyeglasses icon) privileges:

![](../include/img/db-gilmore-dashboard-volume-read-only.png)

In this case, it looks like the volume has been fully shared (unlocked lock icon), so the user has full read access to the volume already.
Prior to the volume being fully shared, the user had read-only access to the private data.

### User Access Privileges

![](../include/img/db-authorized-investigator-manage-affiliates.png)
The *Authorized Investigator* determines what access an *Affiliate* has1. Other researcher's (shared) data on Databrary and 2. the Authorized Investigator's (shared and private) data.

*Affiliate* access expires after a user-defined date.

#### *Affiliate* access to other's data

- *No access* (default)
- *Affiliate*

#### *Affiliate access to an *Authorized Investigator*'s data

A user may be given privileges to a Volume by an *Authorized Investigator*.

- *No access* (default)
<!-- - *View and access only public data* (Level visible only to Super User; probably should deprecate or eliminate.) -->
<!-- - *View and access only shared data*: (Level visible only to Super User; probably should deprecate or eliminate.) -->
- *Read-only access*
- *Read/write access*
- *Manager*
  - Read, write, create volumes, and change volume access (change sharing)

## Databrary 2.0

As of April 2024, Databrary has begun a rewrite led by [Montrose Software](https://montrosesoftware.com).

We are making use of two (currently private) repositories for the rewrite:

- [frontend_2.0](https://github.com/databrary/frontend_2.0)
- [backend_2.0](https://github.com/databrary/backend_2.0)

Once internal licensing discussions have concluded, we may make the repositories public.

### Technology stack

### Frontend

- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- SCSS
- Webpack and npm

### Backend

- Python
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- FFmpeg/Elastic Transcoder
- Docker

### Brainstorming

The following are proposals for discussion, but not requirements for Databrary 2.0.

### User Access Privileges

~~*Affiliate*~~ *Supervised Researcher* access expires after a user-defined date that is no longer than one year from the date of the last update.

#### *Affiliate access to an *Authorized Investigator*'s data

A user may be given privileges to a Volume by an *Authorized Investigator*.

- *No access* (default)
<!-- - *View and access only public data* (Level visible only to Super User; probably should deprecate or eliminate.) -->
<!-- - *View and access only shared data*: (Level visible only to Super User; probably should deprecate or eliminate.) -->
- *Read-only access*
- *Read/write access*
- *Manager*
  - Read, write, create **Private** volumes~~, and change volume access (change sharing)~~

::: {.callout-note}

Per 2024-05-08 meeting with Montrose, we are likely to implement separate categories for Affiliate privileges "Read", "Write", and "Create" and enable various combinations of these, such as "Create" only or "Create" plus "Read" but not write.

:::


#### Volumes

- (New) Set default visibility/access to *Private* (not *Volume Overview*)
- (New) Only *Authorized Investigators* with *Investigator* privileges can delete a *Private* *Volume*.
- (New) Shared (*Volume Overview* or *Entire Volume Shared*) *Volumes* may **hide** data but not delete the volume. Hidden volumes will have the following message: "This volume was hidden on <date> by <user>."
  - Can one *Authorized Investigator* hide a volume, or must all *Authorized Investigators* with share (*Investigator*) privileges agree?
  
::: {.callout-warning}

Some Databrary volumes, e.g., <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/686> have two users with Affiliate privileges, but are listed as *Investigators*, granting them read/write/share (Crown) privileges on the volume.
This arises because the volume citation is built from the list of Investigators.

![Investigators from Volume 686](../include/img/db-volume-686-investigators.png)

In Databrary 2.0, there will be a (new) separate field for bibliographic (citation-source) contributors and individuals derived from the Databrary 1.0 set of Investigators and their appearance order.
Volume sharing privileges will be restricted to Authorized Investigators.
There is likely to be a single owner to simplify various roles, but we will have to permit the existing set of multiple owners.

:::

  
### Requirements

This section provides additional information about the requirements for specific workflows in the Databrary 2.0 application

#### Schema

The Databrary 1.0 schema can be found [here](https://github.com/databrary/databrary/tree/master/schema).

Montrose ^[2024-04-17 meeting] recommends that we implement separate tables for `individuals` and `institutions`.
These entities are combined into a single `party` table in the current schema.

#### Registration workflow

Registration consists of multiple steps.
The following shows requested modifications to the Databrary 1.0 workflow.

##### Create Account

The reference page for the Databrary 1.0 registration process is here:

![](../include/img/db-create-account.JPG)

Fields are as follows:

- *First and Middle Name* (required)
- *Last Name* (required)
- *Email* (required)
  - Add instruction text that specifies an official institutional email must be used for this field (e.g., \@psu.edu).
  - Implement email validation (against existing database of valid institutional email, flag \@gmail.com, etc.)
  - Permit free-text email if validation fails
- *Affiliation* (required)
  - Type-ahead search of existing database of authorized Institutions.
  - If no matching institution exists, the user can enter a new institution, but should be notified.
  - Change label to *Institutional Affiliation*.
  
#### Get Started

![Get Started panel](../include/img/db-get-started.JPG)

- Require user to confirm that they have read and agree to the Databrary Access Agreement.
- Link to the Terms and Conditions of Use.

#### Confirm email

![Confirm Email panel](../include/img/db-confirm-email.JPG)

#### Set Password

![Databrary Set Password panel](../include/img/db-set-password.JPG){fig-align="center"}

- Require strong password (increase number of required characters from 7 to 14 characters. ^[https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/safe-computing/protect-your-privacy/secure-your-passwords.html]
- Validate password to ensure that password is strong

#### Request Authorization

![Databrary Request Authorization panel](../include/img/db-request-authorization.JPG){fig-align="center"}

- Add *new* drop-down menu for *new* `user_position` field that requires users to enter their position at their institution. The acceptable values for this field are as follows:
  - Faculty/Independent Researcher
  - Student
  - Staff
  - Other
- If `user_position` is in {'Student', 'Staff', 'Other'}
  - Show `research_sponsor` text field
    - Add instruction text asking user to type the name of the person who is their research sponsor or supervisor; the entered text should use look-ahead search to match to Authorized Investigators currently active on Databrary at the user's specified institution.
    - If the search succeeds, the user can select the name of their research sponsor.
      - Generate a request for authorization from the current user to the research sponsor; cc the current user.
      - Provide the user feedback that this request has been sent.
    - If the search fails, the user can enter the name of their research sponsor, but warning text appears: "This research sponsor cannot be found."
      - Ask the user to enter their research sponsor's institutional email address.
        - Validate that address as above.
      - Confirm that the user wants Databrary to send a request to register email to the user's research sponsor.
        - If yes, send the email to the research sponsor and cc the current user.
        - **TO-DO**: Draft this email.
- If `user_position` is "Faculty/Independent Researcher"
  - Show *new* text field `user_institutional_profile` and ask user to enter the URL for their institutional profile page.
    - Add explanatory text: "Databrary requires that we confirm a new user is eligible for Authorized Investigator status. Please provide a URL to your personal profile page at your institution to assist us in verifying your status."
  - If user's institution is *not* in Databrary's database of authorizing institutions...
    - Ask user to enter information into two *new* (optional) text fields: `institution_authorizing_official_full_name` for the full name of the institution's authorizing official and `institution_authorizing_official_email` for that person's email.
  - If user's institution is in the Databrary database of authorizing institutions...
    - Show text saying "`institution` has active users on Databrary. Here is a link to other users from `institution` on Databrary: <link-to-institution-page-with-active-users>. Our staff will work with you and your institution to expedite your authorization."
      
### Scoping issues

While the core of Databrary 1.0 is understood and will be replicated in the new version, some questions will be explored that relate to new features:

- Should video and audio transcoding be automatic or optional; if optional, how can transcoding be triggered?
- What features of the existing session/slot spreadsheet interface for managing and visualizing demographic data can be implemented easily and at minimal cost using existing libraries?
- ~~Can two-factor authentication be added? If so, at what cost?~~^[2024-04-17 determined that 2FA via email and SMS should be implemented.]
- Can per-institution (across users and projects), per-user (across projects) or per-project storage quotas be implemented? Can warnings be generated when storage amounts are nearing quotas? How could Super Users manage user requests to increase quotas?
- Can a more informative administrative console be developed with by-volume, usage, and storage metrics, including shared vs. unshared data? If so, at what cost?

### Roadmap

- "Virtual volumes" or cloned/copied datasets with links to original sources.
- Version control.
- More file-, session-, volume-, researcher-, and institution- analytics.
- Private volumes for peer review.
