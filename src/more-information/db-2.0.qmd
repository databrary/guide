# Databrary 2.0 {.unnumbered}

As of April 2024, Databrary has begun a rewrite led by [Montrose Software](https://montrosesoftware.com).

We are making use of two (currently private) repositories for the rewrite:

- [frontend_2.0](https://github.com/databrary/frontend_2.0)
- [backend_2.0](https://github.com/databrary/backend_2.0)

Once internal licensing discussions have concluded, we may make the repositories public.

## Technology stack

### Frontend

- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- SCSS
- Webpack and npm

### Backend

- Python
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- FFmpeg/Elastic Transcoder
- Docker

## Requirements

This section provides additional information about the requirements for specific aspects of the Databrary 2.0 application.

### Schema

The Databrary 1.0 schema can be found [here](https://github.com/databrary/databrary/tree/master/schema).

Montrose ^[2024-04-17 meeting] recommends that we implement separate tables for `individuals` and `institutions`.
These entities are combined into a single `party` table in the current schema.

### User Access Privileges

#### *Affiliate access to an *Authorized Investigator*'s data

A user may be given privileges to a *Volume* by an *Authorized Investigator*.

- ([remove]{.remove-feature}) *No access* (default)
  - This is redundant for the UI. Remove it there. Retain for backend. 
- ([remove]{.remove-feature}) *View and access only public data* (Level visible only to Super User; eliminate.)
- ([remove]{.remove-feature}) *View and access only shared data* (Level visible only to Super User; eliminate.)
- *Read-only access*
- *Read/write access*
- *Manager*
  - Read, write, create **Private** volumes (([new]{.add-feature}) with supervising *Authorized Investigator as the owner*)
  - ([remove]{.remove-feature}) Manager ability to change volume access (change sharing)
  - ([remove]{.remove-feature}) Manager ability to extend access to *Affiliates*

::: {.callout-note}

Per 2024-05-08 meeting with Montrose, we are likely to implement separate categories for Affiliate privileges "Read", "Write", and "Create" and enable various combinations of these, such as "Create" only or "Create" plus "Read" but not write.

### Registration workflow

Registration consists of multiple steps.
The following shows requested modifications to the Databrary 1.0 workflow.

#### Create Account

The reference page for the Databrary 1.0 registration process is here:

![](../include/img/db-create-account.JPG)

Fields are as follows:

- *First and Middle Name* (required)
- *Last Name* (required)
- *Email* (required)
  - Add instruction text that specifies an official institutional email must be used for this field (e.g., \@psu.edu).
  - Implement email validation (against existing database of valid institutional email, flag \@gmail.com, etc.)
  - Permit free-text email if validation fails
- *Affiliation* (required)
  - Type-ahead search of existing database of authorized Institutions.
  - If no matching institution exists, the user can enter a new institution, but should be notified.
  - Change label to *Institutional Affiliation*.
  
#### Get Started

![Get Started panel](../include/img/db-get-started.JPG)

- Require user to confirm that they have read and agree to the Databrary Access Agreement.
- Link to the Terms and Conditions of Use.

#### Confirm email

![Confirm Email panel](../include/img/db-confirm-email.JPG)

#### Set Password

![Databrary Set Password panel](../include/img/db-set-password.JPG){fig-align="center"}

- Require strong password (increase number of required characters from 7 to 14 characters. ^[https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/safe-computing/protect-your-privacy/secure-your-passwords.html]
- Validate password to ensure that password is strong

#### Request Authorization

![Databrary Request Authorization panel](../include/img/db-request-authorization.JPG){fig-align="center"}

- Add *new* drop-down menu for *new* `user_position` field that requires users to enter their position at their institution. The acceptable values for this field are as follows:
  - Faculty/Independent Researcher
  - Student
  - Staff
  - Other
- If `user_position` is in {'Student', 'Staff', 'Other'}
  - Show `research_sponsor` text field
    - Add instruction text asking user to type the name of the person who is their research sponsor or supervisor; the entered text should use look-ahead search to match to Authorized Investigators currently active on Databrary at the user's specified institution.
    - If the search succeeds, the user can select the name of their research sponsor.
      - Generate a request for authorization from the current user to the research sponsor; cc the current user.
      - Provide the user feedback that this request has been sent.
    - If the search fails, the user can enter the name of their research sponsor, but warning text appears: "This research sponsor cannot be found."
      - Ask the user to enter their research sponsor's institutional email address.
        - Validate that address as above.
      - Confirm that the user wants Databrary to send a request to register email to the user's research sponsor.
        - If yes, send the email to the research sponsor and cc the current user.
        - **TO-DO**: Draft this email.
- If `user_position` is "Faculty/Independent Researcher"
  - Show *new* text field `user_institutional_profile` and ask user to enter the URL for their institutional profile page.
    - Add explanatory text: "Databrary requires that we confirm a new user is eligible for Authorized Investigator status. Please provide a URL to your personal profile page at your institution to assist us in verifying your status."
  - If user's institution is *not* in Databrary's database of authorizing institutions...
    - Ask user to enter information into two *new* (optional) text fields: `institution_authorizing_official_full_name` for the full name of the institution's authorizing official and `institution_authorizing_official_email` for that person's email.
  - If user's institution is in the Databrary database of authorizing institutions...
    - Show text saying "`institution` has active users on Databrary. Here is a link to other users from `institution` on Databrary: <link-to-institution-page-with-active-users>. Our staff will work with you and your institution to expedite your authorization."

![Timeline from <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/339/slot/16961/->](img/volume-339-slot-16961.png){#fig-vol-339-slot-1681}
- ([remove]{.remove-feature}): Timeline.

![](img/session-download-all-files-as-zip.png)

- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): "Download all files as zip". With large sessions and/or large files, the zip files are also large and require application resources to create. Are there any third party libraries we could use that would off-load this process? *Note:* This problem is larger with the "Download all folders as zip" function on the volumes page.

### Super User/Admin panel

- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Now that institutions and users are separate in the database schema, can we prevent the accidental creation of new institutions via the API? In Databrary 1.0, it appears that new users who do *not* give an email are created as parties with the is_institution flag set to true.

### User profile

- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Toggle volume view between short-name and long name.

### API

- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Are we creating a new version of the API?
- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): What are best practices for supporting external scripting access (via e.g., *databraryr* or *databrarypy*) while maintaining system security?
- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): We have users who want Databrary to support [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cross-origin-resource-sharing/). How do we do this? Should it be on an application by application basis?

## Scoping

### Databrary 2.0 rewrite

While the core of Databrary 1.0 is understood and will be replicated in Databrary 2.0, some questions will be explored that relate to new features:

#### File uploads/downloads

- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Should video and audio transcoding be automatic or optional; if optional, how can transcoding be triggered?
  - Should transcoding be "premium" service?

#### Spreadsheet

- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): (What features of the existing session/slot spreadsheet interface for managing and visualizing demographic data can be implemented easily and at minimal cost using existing libraries?

See also [below](db-2.0.qmd#support-for-open-data-schemas) section on support for schemas.

#### Security

- ~~Can two-factor authentication be added? If so, at what cost?~~^[2024-04-17 determined that 2FA via email and SMS should be implemented.]

#### Admin/Superuser

- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Can per-institution (across users and projects), per-user (across projects) or per-project storage quotas be implemented? Can warnings be generated when storage amounts are nearing quotas? How could Super Users manage user requests to increase quotas?
- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Can a more informative administrative console be developed with by-volume, usage, and storage metrics, including shared vs. unshared data? If so, at what cost?

See also section [below](db-2.0.qmd#administrative-upgrades) about other administrative upgrades.
This will probably get pushed to later.

#### Access to volumes

- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Volume access expires after a user-defined date that is no longer than one year from the date of the last update.

### Roadmap (>2.0)

These ideas are on the longer-term roadmap.

#### Support for open data schemas

##### JSON-LD

- Databrary should eventually support standard schemas wherever practical, specifically in the [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) format. These should use [Schema.org](https://schema.org) properties.
- Examples of properties that seem relevant to Databrary include:
  - [*Person*](https://schema.org/Person)
  - [*Creative Work*](https://schema.org/CreativeWork)
    - [VideoObject](https://schema.org/VideoObject)
  - [*Event*](https://schema.org/Intangible)
      - For a data collection session or change in status on the site.
  - [*Place*](https://schema.org/Place)
      - Testing locations, geographical information, locations of institutions
  - [Data Types](https://schema.org/DataType)

::: {.callout-note}
These examples are not exhaustive.
:::

- By support, I mean that the application should add relevant schema information to the JSON data provided by the API.

##### NIH CDE

- Databrary should also support [NIH Common Data Elements (CDEs)](https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/home), especially for "spreadsheet" data elements.
- Examples of CDE properties of a [*Person*](https://schema.org/Person)
  - *Gender*: <https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/formView?tinyId=vx35JcbgJI>
  - *Sex at Birth*: <https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=rGEh0ckdmr>
  - *Race*: <https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=Fakc6Jy2x>
  - *Race/Ethnicity Self-Identification*: <https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=LakF0YkywC>
  - *Ethnicity*: <https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=PtRlg7yLP_>
  - *Disabilities*: <https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=0md12WGtZXE>
  - *Birth date*: <https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=X1mJv5j3jx>.
  - *List of languages*: <https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=7JDyF9o3ie>
    - *Language secondary text*: <https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/deView?tinyId=mJsWHcxje9W>
  
::: {.callout-note}
There are a set of CDEs that NIH endorses. These should probably be the highest priority.
:::

- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Should specific data elements be represented in the database schema explicitly? Would doing so make it easier to search and filter data by these characteristics?
- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Should the database schema support linking data about the same individuals? This would require supporting something like the NIMH GUID, and possibly some additional data sharing consent language that permits data linkage.
- ([discuss]{.discuss-feature}): Should *species* and other terms commonly used in non-human animal research be incorporated and supported. 

::: {.callout-note}
It does not appear that there are NIH-Endorsed elements that contain the term "species".
:::

#### Improved search and filtering

Ideas from HNDS-I 2024 proposal:

1. Broader set of demographic characteristics.
2. Index other text documents (protocols, coding manuals) in materials folders.

##### Index annotation files, return segments

> "Building on this foundation, we will upgrade Databrary to support searching within annotation files linked to videos that tag specific behaviors, utterances, or contexts, starting with the most popular annotation file formats stored on Databrary (Datavyu and CHAT)"

--- HNDS-I proposal.

#### "Virtual volumes" or custom collections

>To capitalize on enhanced search and filtering and ease data reuse, users must be able to create their own custom collections of video files, video segments, annotations, and other data derived from multiple, primary datasets. The custom collections or “virtual datasets” will link to but not copy parent datasets and their associated metadata.

--- HNDS-I proposal.

#### Workspaces

>...We will implement private, flexible, temporary workspaces for datasets that act like folders in cloud storage. Unlike other forms of cloud storage that provide only a temporary home for research data, Databrary’s workspaces will provide a permanent and flexible home that is just a button press away from being made accessible to the broader research community.

-- HNDS-I proposal.

#### Expanding scriptable access

>...We will build on the free, open-source, R package, *databraryr*, that PI Gilmore developed with NSF support and openly released to the research community. Databraryr wraps Databrary API calls into commands that are useful to researchers who want to download shared data from Databrary. We will add data uploading capabilities to the R package to support Aim 3, develop and publish a parallel Python package, *databrarypy*.

-- HNDS-I proposal.

#### Administrative upgrades

- Quotas on per-user, per-institution storage footprints.
- Infrastructure for managing subscriptions, curation assistance, data deposit fees.
- Links to institutional admin panel functions; data footprint, etc.

#### Version control

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and [OSF](https://osf.io) implement this.

#### Private volumes for peer review

[OSF](https://osf.io) implements this.
