# User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

## About

This document describes the procedure for conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT) on the staging and production Databrary servers.

## Staging

Databrary maintains a staging server at stg-databrary.its.nyu.edu.

Access to the application on staging is restricted to Databrary staff and developers.

Moreover, staging is only accessible behind the NYU VPN at vpnsec.vpn.it.nyu.edu using the authorized VPN application.

## Production

The production server is available at nyu.databrary.org.

Super Admin access to the application admin panel also requires access through the NYU VPN.
