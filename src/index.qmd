## Welcome {-}

This document describes the [Databrary.org](https://databrary.org) data library and how to use it effectively as a tool for safely and securely sharing identifiable research data including video and audio.

Databrary is used by a large and growing community of researchers across the globe, including some large scale research projects [@Soska2021-mh] run by Databrary's co-founders, Karen Adolph and Rick Gilmore, and their collaborators.

Databrary's founders believe that the widespread use and sharing of video can improve reproducibility and rigor of many different areas of research [@Adolph_KE_Gilmore_RO_Kennedy_JL2017-va; @Gilmore2017-wd].

This guide was written by [Rick Gilmore](https://rick-gilmore.com), Andrea Seisler, Melody Xu, and Yinghe Liu.
