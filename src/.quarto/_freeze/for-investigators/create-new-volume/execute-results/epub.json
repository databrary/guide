BEFORE collecting data is the best time to start planning for curation of your project. In this case, you would utilize the upload as you go method of data curation. \n\nComplete Steps 1-5, 7, and 8 Now.\n\nAfter each data collection session, follow the directions for [Enter Data Individually](#individually) in Step 6.\n\n### Ongoing {-}\n\n\n\n### Completed {-}\n\nThe following items need to be considered to prepare for upload:\n\n- Do you have (at least some of) participantsâ€™ permission to share their data with other authorized Databrary investigators? If not, who is allowed access to the videos?\n- Do you have IRB permission to share the data on Databrary?\n- All video tapes need to be digitized\n- How are the data organized? Will these need to be re-organized to utilize the Databrary Spreadsheet structure?\n\n## Step 1: Login/Go to Profile {- #step1}\n\nClick the pink `Login` button in the middle of the [Databrary homepage](https://nyu.databrary.org/) to sign into your Databrary account.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nClick on `Your Profile`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/db-main-page-logged-in.JPG){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Begin Create Volume {- #step2}\n\nClick on `Create Volume` to the right of **Data Owner Volumes**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/db-create-volume.JPG){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple tabs on the left side of the screen that need to be completed to set up a new volume. These tabs need to be completed in order.\n\n## Step 3: Enter Dataset Overview {- #step3}\n\nVolume **Overview** is created by choosing if the volume is related to a published resource and answering the related questions (Title, Description, Internal Short Name and additional citation information if necessary). \n\nPlease describe the context of data collection and the types of data that will be uploaded (e.g. video, pictures, coding files, survey data, etc.). The recommended template is provided. Please be sure to fill in all of the brackets with the relevant information for your volume.\n\n   This dataset focuses on [**Provide provide a description of behavor, location of study, and age range**].  Dataset includes [**Enter description of videos, questionnaires, materials, etc.**]\n   \n   Videos were [**Provide provide a general description of what the videos were coded for.
