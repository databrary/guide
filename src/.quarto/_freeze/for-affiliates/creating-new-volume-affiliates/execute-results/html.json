We encourage corresponding actions to be performed before the project is in collecting data process. In this case, you would utilize the upload as you go method of data curation. \n\nWe have intentionally limited the permissions to manage the volume to ensure data security. Creating volumes is a privilege granted to the project's **Manager** status affiliates, and sharing the volume is **not** allowed for affiliates.\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n**Volumes cannot be deleted once created.** \n:::\n\nIf you have created a volume by mistake, you can hide the volume by restricting access to others or rename the volume so that it can be reused by another future project. \n\n\n## Step 1: Login/Go to Profile {- #affiliates-step1}\n\nLet's get started with creating a new volume.\n\nReview [Onborading-affiliates](onboarding-affiliates.qmd) for how to find your profile.\n\n![Volumes you own or shared by others](img/db-dashboard-shared-volume.png){#dashboard-volumes}\n\n## Step 2: Look for Create a new volume button {- #affiliates-step2}\n\nIf the button is not available, check your sponsor status by reviewing your profile.\nIf you are not granted with **Manager** status, you will not be able to create a new volume.\n\n![Affiliates with Read-only Access](img/db-profile-sponsor.png){#profile-sponsor}\n\nRead-Only access will not allow you to create a new volume. Only affiliates granted with **Manager** status will be able to create a new volume. Meanwhile, affiliates at all circumstances may not share access to the volume with others even with the manager status.\n\n![Affiliates with the manager status.](img/db-profile-sponsor-manager.png){#profile-sponsor-manager}\n\nIf you have been granted with access to create a new volume, you will see the button `Create a new volume` under **Your Sponsor Volumes**. \n\n![Create a new volume](img/db-dashboard-create-volume.png){#dashboard-create-volume}\n\n## Step 3: Click Create a new volume button to create a new volume {- #affiliates-step3}\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nAgain, creating a new volume with careful consideration is important.
