If you don't receive the email within a few minutes, check your spam folder.\n\n![Databrary screen indicating confirmation email has been sent](img/db-confirm-email.JPG){#fig-confirmation-email fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWhat the email looks like: \n\n![Sample Databrary registration email](img/db-registration-email.png){#fig-registration-email fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Choosing a password {-}\n\nNext, please choose a password. \n\n![Databrary Set Password screen](img/db-set-password.JPG){#fig-set-password fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nKeep your account credentials secret and do not share them with anyone.\nEach Databrary user must have their own login and password.\nIt is violation of the Databrary Access Agreement and common sense to share login credentials with another user.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nWe strongly recommend using a password generation or manager program or the password manager built-in to many modern web browsers.\n\n:::\n\n### Requesting authorization {-}\n\nEvery Databrary user who seeks access to restricted data must request and be granted authorization for that access.\n*Authorized Investigators* must secure authorization from an *institution*.\n*Affiliate Investigators* must secure authorization from an *Authorized Investigator*.\n\nPlease read the requirements for *Authorized Investigator* and *Affiliate*. Choose the radio button that accurately reflects your qualifications.\n\n![Databrary Request Authorization screen](img/db-request-authorization.JPG){#fig-request-authorization  fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n#### Registering as an *Authorized Investigator* at an Institution: {-}\n\n1. Select the `Authorized Investigator` radio button and search for your institution. \n    * If your institution is not found in the drop down box, please select 'Other' and provide more information on the next screen.\n2. This will auto-generate a notification to the Databrary team.\n3. Databrary's authorization team will be in touch (typically within 24-48 business hours) to help you through the process and initiate a DocuSign envelope for signature.\n\n![Authorized Investigator request](img/db-request-authorization-AI-other.JPG)\n\n![Other information request](img/db-submit-authorization-AI-other.JPG)\n\n#### Registering as an *Affiliate* of an Authorized Investigator: {-}\n\nYou can only do this if your Supervisor or Research Sponsor ALREADY has a Databrary Account.\n\n1. Select the `Affiliate` radio button and search for your Supervisor or Research Sponsor's name. \n2. Your Supervisor or Research Sponsor Investigator will receive a notification that you have applied for access, and can approve you. \n\n![Affiliate request](img/db-request-authorization-affiliate.JPG)\n\nIf you need to request Affiliate Authorization in a separate session from creating your account, you may go to your Supervisor or Research Sponsors page on Databrary and request Affiliate Access from them.\n\n<!-- ****ADD PICTURE HERE**** -->\n\n### Awaiting authorization {-}\n\nThe process of securing authorization can take a few hours, or a few days or weeks.\nInstitutions that have many active Databrary users are familiar with the system and *usually* process authorization requests quickly.\n\nThe Databrary staff will work closely with you to expedite your authorization.\n\nOnce authorized, you will receive an email confirmation.\n\nIn the meantime, you can set up your Databrary profile, as described in the next section.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../include/css/style.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"output-file":"requesting-access.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
