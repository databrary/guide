{"title":"Software","markdown":{"headingText":"Software","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis page describes some useful information about Databrary's software.\n\n## Databrary 1.0\n\nThe Databrary application runs on a virtual machine running CentOS managed by NYU IT.\nAutomatic transcoding of all uploaded video and audio files is handled by NYU's High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.\nData is stored in Isilon arrays that are managed by the NYU Libraries.\n\n### Frontend\n\n- AngularJS 1.4\n- Coffee Script 1.7.1\n- JQuery 1.12.3\n- Stylus 0.54.5 + nib 1.1.2\n\n### Backend\n\n- GHC 8.0.2\n- Haskell 2010\n- Solr 6.6\n- PostgreSQL 9.5\n- FFmpeg 4.2.4\n\n### Application\n\nDatasets are organized into separate volumes with system-wide unique (integer) identifiers. \nGroups of data files related to a specific person or people (or non-human animal), a date, time, and location are grouped into sessions (slots) within a volume. \nIndividual files (assets) of varying types are organized within a session (slot). Sessions (slots) and files (assets) are assigned system-wide unique (integer) identifiers.\n\nIndividual users and institutions (called parties) are assigned system-wide unique identifiers and have some overlapping data elements (e.g., prename, sortname). \nAccess privileges are granted hierarchically in a parent/child organization. \nFor example, Databrary is the parent of New York University (NYU); NYU is the parent of Karen Adolph and multiple other *Authorized Investigators*; Karen Adolph is the parent of multiple Affiliate investigators who have broad access to volumes Dr. Adolph has created. \nFurther details about how *Authorized Investigators* assign access permission to *Affiliates* can be found in the Principal System Roles section below.\n\n### Sharing Release Levels\n\nRestricted data and metadata are controlled by a specific set of sharing release levels (https://databrary.org/support/irb/release-levels.html).\nThese levels apply at the session/slot and file/asset level. \nNewly uploaded files default to Private. \nThe terminology associated with these levels, the icons used to identify the levels, and the level of user access permitted by the levels are deeply embedded in the Databrary policy framework. \n\n### API\n\nAll Databrary frontend calls use the API. The volume/slot/asset identifier scheme described previously supports API calls of the following form:\n\nhttps://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1/slot/9807?asset=9200\n\nThis call accesses the Databrary “leaf” logo in volume 1, slot (session) 9807, with asset ID 9200. Similarly, https://nyu.databrary.org/party/12 returns information about all of the *Authorized Investigators* who are authorized through party 12, The Pennsylvania State University.\n\nMost, but not all of the Databrary API is [documented](https://github.com/databrary/route-doc). \nIf it is necessary to change the API calls in the rewrite, then the API should be versioned, and the new system should support current API calls.\n\n### Backend Services\n\nAll audio and video files uploaded automatically generate transcoding jobs that are handled by the NYU HPC.\n\nThe system mints a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) when a volume is shared. \nThis must continue. Databrary piggybacks on the DOI account controlled by NYU Libraries. \n\nThe system generates and updates standard bibliographic citations for a volume based on volume data and metadata.\n\n### System roles\n\n#### Super user\n\nThe system supports a small number of *Super User* accounts. \nOnly an existing *Super User* can grant *Super User* privileges to another account holder. \n*Super User* have the following privileges:\n\n- Editing user (party) account information\n- Changing a user’s parent (sponsor) and child (affiliate) links\n- Granting or removing system-wide access privileges\n- Resetting user passwords\n- Monitoring and managing the health of the system as a whole, including restarting stalled video transcoding jobs via an admin dashboard\n- Generating email related to the process for requesting authorization from an institution for specific users\n\n#### User\n\nThe system supports user accounts with the following features and privileges:\n\n- Account creation\n- Requesting authorization from an institution or individual (party)\n- Editing user profile information (ORCID, web site, social media, additional email accounts, department)\n- Two tiers of access: *Authorized Investigators* and *Affiliates* (*Affiliates* replaced by new term: *Sponsored Researchers*)\n  - *Authorized Investigators* are specifically linked to an authorizing institution (party) when the Super User establishes that link. *Authorized Investigators* can:\n    - Create, edit, share, and unshare volumes\n    - Create, edit, and delete sessions (slots) in volumes they own or co-own\n    - Upload, download, modify, and delete files (assets) in sessions in volumes they own or co-own\n    - Modify which other users (*Authorized Investigators* or *Sponsored Researchers*) have access to a volume, session (slot), or file (asset); this includes removing access.\n    - With regard to x* (formerly *Affiliates*), *Authorized Investigators* determine:\n      - The *Sponsored Researcher*’s level of access to all of Databrary (no access or full access to shared data)\n      - The *Sponsored Researcher*’s level of access to the *Authorized Investigator*’s data (no access; read-only access; read/write access; manager access)\n    - Modify the level (sharing release level) assigned to a session (slot) or file (asset)\n  - *Sponsored Researchers* (formerly *Affiliates*) privileges to access restricted data on Databrary are specifically linked to one or more *Authorized Investigators*. The *Authorized Investigator* controls that link. Links should expire on a regular (timed) basis. When linked to an *Authorized Investigator*, *Sponsored Researchers* have the level of access granted by that *Authorized Investigator* to i) Databrary as a whole (default is none) and ii) to specific volumes owned by the *Authorized Investigator*.\n\n## Databrary 2.0\n\nAs of April 2024, Databrary has begun a rewrite led by [Montrose Software](https://montrosesoftware.com).\n\nWhile the core of the system is understood and will be replicated in the new version, some questions will be explored that relate to new features:\n\n- Should video and audio transcoding be automatic or optional; if optional, how can transcoding be triggered?\n- What features of the existing session/slot spreadsheet interface for managing and visualizing demographic data can be implemented easily and at minimal cost using existing libraries?\n- Can two-factor authentication be added? If so, at what cost?\n- Can per-institution (across users and projects), per-user (across projects) or per-project storage quotas be implemented? Can warnings be generated when storage amounts are nearing quotas? How could Super Users manage user requests to increase quotas?\n- Can a more informative administrative console be developed with by-volume, usage, and storage metrics, including shared vs. unshared data? If so, at what cost?\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../include/css/style.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"output-file":"software.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
