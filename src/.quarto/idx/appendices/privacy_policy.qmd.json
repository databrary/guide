Consent {-} \n----------\n\nBy using our Websites, you acknowledge and accept the privacy practices\ndescribed in this Privacy Policy. If you choose to publish personal\ninformation on our Websites, it will be made available to other users.\n\n4. Changes to this Privacy Policy {-} \n---------------------------------\n\nWe may modify this Privacy Policy in whole or in part at any time. The\nmodified policy will be posted on our Websites with an updated effective\ndate. Please review any posted changes to our Privacy Policy carefully.\nIf you agree to the terms, simply continue to use our Websites. If you\nobject to any of the changes to our Privacy Policy, please do not\ncontinue to access our Websites, as your continued use of our Websites\nand Services after we have posted a notice of changes to the Privacy\nPolicy shall constitute your consent to the changed terms or practices.\nNote that any personal data we collect about you is subject to the\nPrivacy Policy in effect at the time of its collection, and, further,\nthat you have certain rights with respect to that personal data, as\ndescribed in this Privacy Policy.\n\n5. Content {-} \n----------\n\nDatabrary's mission is to accelerate scientific discovery by\nfacilitating the storage, sharing, and re-use of Research Data,\nincluding Restricted Data like video and audio recordings. Where\nRestricted Data about humans are stored and shared, the permission of\nresearch participants or the waiver of the requirement for that\npermission by an Institution is required. This means that Authorized\nUsers can upload to Databrary research-related information (\"Content\")\nas permitted by their institutions, including, but not limited to, data\nfiles, procedural videos, videos of research participation, consent\nforms, participant demographics or characteristics, coding sheets, and\nanalysis scripts and output. In uploading or downloading Content,\nAuthorized Users agree to uphold the highest ethical standards, as laid\nout in the [Databrary Access Agreement]\n(https://databrary.org/about/agreement.html). Ultimately,\nAuthorized Users are in control of both the nature of the Content stored\non Databrary, and with whom and to what extent that Content is shared,\nwithin the bounds of what Research Data participants agreed to share and\nwhat use has been authorized by the Authorized User's Institution.\n\n6. Information Collected {-} \n------------------------\n\n### Information Collected from Users {-} \n\nUnless you are a member of the general public with limited viewing\nrights to Content, in order to fully use our Websites, you must register\nand create an account that provides us with your name, institutional\nemail address, institution name, profile web page at your institution, a\npassword, and permission to contact your institution's appointed\ncontracts agent and related contact information in order to complete a\nDatabrary Access Agreement on your behalf.\n\nIf you are authorized by your Institution to access to Databrary, either\nas an Authorized Investigator or as an Affiliate, you will be asked to\nenter your institutional email address (user ID) and Databrary password\nfor all subsequent access. In accessing Databrary as an Authorized User,\nyou agree to keep the information you have provided us (name, email,\ninstitution) current and accurate. Your information may be modified by\naccessing your user profile. If you choose to cancel your Databrary\naccess, you may delete your user account by emailing\n<contact@databrary.org>.\n\nYou may optionally provide a profile picture and your unique ORCID\n<https://orcid.org/> identifier. If you choose to provide us with any\nadditional information about yourself, including through an e-mail\nmessage, form, survey, etc., we will take every precaution to keep the\ninformation confidential and protect your privacy to the extent\nallowable by law.\n\n#### How We Use the Information Collected from Users {-} \n\nYour Databrary account will be used to organize, track, and label any\ndata you might choose to upload, as well as to track any Content you\ndownload from our Website. This is done so that we can obtain aggregated\nusage statistics and to identify the account responsible for any\nbreaches of the Databrary Access Agreement, Terms of Service, or this\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nWe may periodically contact you via email to notify you of changes or\nimprovements in the Databrary website, to ask you for feedback on our\nservice, or to notify you of changes in Databrary's policies. In rare\ncases, we may contact you with information related to a specific dataset\nyou have downloaded (e.g., if a participant or researcher has revoked\nconsent to share the data). You may opt out of automatic communications\nin the Notifications section of your user profile.\n\n### Information Collected and Stored Automatically {-} \n\n#### Log files and IP addresses {-} \n\nWe may collect information from the devices and networks that you use to\nvisit our Websites in order to help improve the services we provide,\nincluding the date and time of your visit, the operating system of your\ncomputer or device, the version of the web browser or other program you\nuse, the Application Programming Interface (\"API\") you use, your\nmobile device carrier, your Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\"), and\nyour Internet Protocol Address (IP Address). An IP address is a number\nthat is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the\nInternet. For example, when you request a page from one of our sites,\nour servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user\ndemographics, traffic patterns, and for purposes of system\nadministration. Every time you request or download a file from one of\nour Websites, Databrary may store data about these events and your IP\naddress in a log file. We may use this information to analyze trends,\nadminister the site, track users' movements, and gather broad\ndemographic information for aggregate use or for other business\npurposes. When you access or leave our Websites by clicking on a\nhyperlink, we may receive the URL from the site from which you last\nvisited or the one to which you're directed. We also may receive\nlocation data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled\ndevices that you have set up in order to customize your experience based\non location information.\n\n#### Cookies {-} \n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile device\nidentifiers, to help us recognize you when you log into our Websites and\nServices.

Databrary can read the cookies whenever you visit our\nWebsites. We may use cookies in a number of ways, such as to save the\nfact that you are logged into the system so you don't have to login in\neach time you visit our Website, to deliver content specific to your\ninterests, and to track the pages you've visited. These cookies allow\nus to use the information we collect to customize your experience so\nthat your visit to our Websites and your use of our Services are as\nrelevant and as valuable to you as possible. You may modify and control\nhow and when cookies are set through your browser settings. Most\nbrowsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to control or\nreject cookies in the \"Help\" section of the toolbar. We do not link\nnon-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable\ninformation without your permission.\n\n#### Web Beacons {-} \n\nOur Websites also may use web beacons and other technologies, such as\npixels and JavaScript tags, to collect non-personal information about\nyour use of our site and the sites you visit, your use of special\nannouncements or newsletters, and other activities.

We also periodically monitor our system for possible\nvulnerabilities and attacks, consistent with industry standards. In the\nevent of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any\nrequired legal process, information from these sources may be used to\nhelp identify an individual.\n\nYou should be aware, however, that since the Internet is not a 100%\nsecure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any\ninformation that you submit to the site. There is also no guarantee that\ninformation may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by\nbreach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It\nis your responsibility to protect the security and integrity of your\naccount details, including your username and password. To maintain the\nsecurity of your information, you must keep your username(s) and\npassword(s) strictly confidential and not disclose them to anyone. You\nwill be solely responsible for any action, activities, and access to our\nWebsites that are taken using your username and password and that\noccurred before you notified us of their loss.\n\nIf you become aware of any security breach of your password or of the\nsecurity of the Websites or Services, you must contact us as soon as\npossible at <info@databrary.org>.\n\n11. Data Retention {-} \n------------------\n\nWe will keep your personal information for as long as your account is\nactive or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, even after\nyou've closed your account, such as to fulfill our obligations to our\nothers (including as described in Section 8), meet regulatory\nrequirements, resolve disputes between users, to prevent fraud and\nabuse, or to enforce this Privacy Policy. We may be required to retain\npersonal information for a limited period of time if requested by law\nenforcement. We also may retain indefinitely non-personally\nidentifiable, aggregate data to facilitate our ongoing operations.\n\n12. Data transfer {-} \n-----------------\n\nDatabrary may store and process personal information on servers or on a\ncloud located outside of the country where you originally deposited\ndata. The data-protection laws of the country or countries where this\npersonal information will be stored or processed might not be as\ncomprehensive as those in your country. If you are unsure whether this\nPrivacy Policy is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should\nnot submit your information to Databrary. If you are located within the\nEuropean Economic Area (see 13. General Data Protection Regulation), you\nshould note that your information will be transferred to the United\nStates, which is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data\nprotection. By using our Websites and/or directly providing personal\ninformation to us, you hereby agree to and acknowledge your\nunderstanding of the terms of this Privacy Policy, and consent to have\nyour personal data transferred to and processed in the United States\nand/or in other jurisdictions as determined by Databrary,\nnotwithstanding your country of origin, or country, state, and/or\nprovince of residence.\n\n13. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) {-} \n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are a resident of or are located in the European Economic Area\n(\"EEA\"), you may have certain rights under the General Data Protection\nRegulation (\"GDPR\"). Personal data you provide is only collected with\nyour consent, and may be transmitted outside of the EEA to Databrary (or\ncomputer servers maintained for the benefit of Databrary) pursuant to\nthat consent.\n\nIn general, under the GDPR you may:\n\n-   request access to your personal data.\n\n-   have incomplete or incorrect data corrected.\n\n-   have your personal data deleted.\n\n-   suspend or restrict our use of your personal data, or withdraw your\n    consent.\n\n-   request a copy of your personal data.\n\n-   complain to a supervisory authority if you believe your rights under\n    the GDPR are not being respected.\n\nShould you request a copy of your personal data, we will supply to you a\ncopy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of\ncharge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.\n\nShould you request the deletion of your personal data, Databrary will\ngenerally do so as soon as practicable, although your right to have your\npersonal data deleted is subject to exceptions, such as, for example,\ncompliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or\ndefense of legal claims. If you consider that our processing of your\npersonal information infringes on data-protection laws, you have a legal\nright to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for\ndata protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual\nresidence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.\n\nContact Databrary at <contact@databrary.org> if you have concerns\nregarding your personal data, or wish to exercise any of these listed\nrights.\n\nNote that, if you are in the EEA, we may transfer your personal data\noutside of the EEA, including to the United States. By way of example,\nthis may happen if your personal data is transferred to our servers\nlocated in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not have\nsimilar data-protection laws to the EEA. By submitting your personal\ndata, you're agreeing to this transfer, storing, or processing. If we\ntransfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take\nsteps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the\naim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as\noutlined in this policy. As part of New York University, Databrary\nshares NYU's appointed Data Protection Officer. For more information,\nemail <info@databrary.org>.\n\n### GDPR and Research Contents {-} \n\nBecause Databrary's Contents are stored on servers located in the\nUnited States, Restricted Data stored on Databrary may be accessed and\nre-used by researchers outside of the EEA. As described in the Databrary\nAccess Agreement, Institutions and Authorized Users have obligations to\nensure that consent sufficient to meet GDPR provisions was obtained from\nresearch participants prior to storing information on Databrary or\nsharing it with other Authorized Users. The same requirement to ensure\nthat adequate consent to meet GDPR provisions was obtained from research\nparticipants applies when you, an Authorized User, downloads Contents\nshared by other Authorized Users from any jurisdiction.\n\n14.
