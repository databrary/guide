{"title":"Formal Access Agreement","markdown":{"headingText":"Formal Access Agreement","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe Databrary Access Agreement has four parts: A main section plus three Annexes.\n\n## Databrary Access Agreement {- #daa}\n\n*Version date: April 29, 2020*\n\nThe undersigned Institution\\--an academic, research, government, or\nhealth entity---grants permission for its Authorized Investigators,\nidentified below and in Annex II, (\"List of Authorized Investigators\")\nto access Databrary.\n\nDatabrary is a web-based data library housed at New York University\ndesigned for sharing behavioral data, including video files and\nassociated metadata. Authorized Investigators approved by their\nInstitutions for access to Databrary may access data shared by others\nand/or contribute data for others to access. Databrary requires that an\nAuthorized Investigator secure Institutional approval, usually from a\nresearch ethics board, before contributing personally identifiable human\nor non-human animal data to Databrary or conducting research on any data\nobtained from others through Databrary. Databrary, however, does not\nrequire Institutional approval for permitted non-research uses (e.g.,\npre-research, preliminary analysis, self-study, teaching) beyond this\nDatabrary Access Agreement.\n\nAll Institutions and Authorized Investigators agree to use Databrary and\ndata obtained through it exclusively for the purpose of non-commercial\nscientific research or education.\n\nBy signing this Databrary Access Agreement, the Institution verifies\nthat (a) it maintains or uses an ethics board or Institutional Review\nBoard with U.S.-equivalent standards that reviews and approves research\ninvolving human subjects, (b) it reviews and approves research involving\nnon-human animal subjects, (c) its Authorized Investigators have\ntraining that addresses research ethics with human subjects and/or\nnon-human animals, (d) its Authorized Investigators are eligible to\nconduct independent research at the Institution, (e) its use of\nDatabrary will comply with this Databrary Access Agreement, and it\naccepts responsibility for its Authorized Investigators' and other\nemployees' actions related to the use of Databrary, (f) it grants\nAuthorized Investigators the authority to choose and manage affiliates,\nand (g) the person executing this Databrary Access Agreement on behalf\nof the Institution has the authority to do so.\n\nThe Institution and the Authorized Investigators agree that Databrary,\nNew York University, The Pennsylvania State University, and the relevant\nfunding agencies bear no responsibility for the use of Databrary or the\ninformation contained within it. Except in cases where the Institution\nis expressly prohibited by law from indemnifying third parties, the\nInstitution indemnifies and renders harmless Databrary, New York\nUniversity, and The Pennsylvania State University from all claims,\nlosses, liability, and other damages that arise from violations of this\nAccess Agreement by the Institution or the Institution's Authorized\nInvestigators. In cases where the Institution is prohibited by law from\nindemnifying third parties, in accordance with and to the extent\npermitted and limited by a superseding national, state, or local\nprovision, statute, or law, the Institution agrees that it will be\nresponsible for the payment of claims, including for loss, personal\ninjury, death, property damage, or otherwise, arising out of any act or\nomission of its employees or agents in connection with the performance\nof this agreement for which it is held liable under applicable law. It\nis understood and agreed that this document shall constitute a separate\nagreement between Databrary and the Institution, as amended from time to\ntime by the Institution and Databrary, to include additional Authorized\nInvestigators as listed in Annex II, to include new datasets available\nto Authorized Investigators, and to expand the uses allowed for shared\ndatasets.\n\nBy signing this Databrary Access Agreement, effective as of the date\nentered below, the Institution and its Authorized Investigators\n(optionally listed under Annex II) hereby agree to its terms, including\nthose found in the attached Annex I (\"Statement of Rights and\nResponsibilities\"), and in the attached Annex III (\"Databrary Access\nGuide\"). The Databrary Access Guide may be amended from time to time.\nDatabrary will notify the Institution and its Authorized Investigators\nof any amendments to the Databrary Access Guide by email and

adhere to the Terms of the [Databrary\nAccess Agreement](#daa), [Annex I](#daa_annex_I) (\"Statement of Rights and Responsibilities\"), and [Annex III](#daa_annex_III) (\"Databrary Access Guide\").\n\nAuthorized Investigators acknowledge and agree to comply with\nDatabrary's three guiding ethical principles, which are to:\n\n-   Treat data stored and shared via Databrary with the same high\n    standard of care that Authorized Investigators treat data collected\n    in their own labs.\n\n-   Respect the permissions research participants have given regarding\n    data sharing.\n\n-   Take care in authorizing Affiliates access to Databrary and take\n    responsibility for Affiliates' conduct and use of Databrary.\n\nAdditionally, Authorized Investigators agree to:\n\n-   Comply with their Institution's policies on the conduct of\n    research.\n\n-   Complete training that meets the Institution's standards addressing\n    the ethics of research with human subjects, and as

Databrary's\nmission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and\nrelated data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral,\neducational, and neural sciences.\n\nThe responsibility for protecting research data and research\nparticipants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their\nAffiliates, Institutions, and Databrary.\n\nDatabrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video\nand related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is\nrestricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by\ntheir Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of\nAuthorized Investigators through a research ethics board or\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that\nrequired to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S.\nGovernment (see:\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html).\nAuthorized Investigators who share data with others must secure\npermission to share from research participants and record that\npermission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized\nInvestigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other\nAuthorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles,\nincluding respect for the sharing permissions granted by research\nparticipants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights\nof research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data.\n\n##### The Databrary Access Agreement permits data use and data contribution  {-}\n\nDatabrary restricts access to Authorized Investigators whose\nInstitutions sign a formal Databrary Access Agreement.\n\nThe Databrary Access Agreement combines provisions for data use and data\ncontribution. Unlike data use agreements that allow specific individuals\naccess to a particular dataset for a discrete research purpose, the\nDatabrary Access Agreement allows any Authorized Investigator to access\nall shared datasets on Databrary and use the datasets for many different\nInstitutionally-approved purposes. In addition, the Databrary Access\nAgreement permits Authorized Investigators to upload data and to share\nit with other Authorized Investigators in accord with the sharing\npermissions granted by participants and any required Institutional\napprovals. Databrary believes that combining data use and data\ncontribution in a single agreement reduces barriers to data sharing,\nmeets emerging funder mandates to share research data, and accelerates\nprogress in research.\n\n##### Video's use cases extend beyond research  {-}\n\nIn addition to its many uses in research, video may be used for a\nvariety of pre-research and non-research uses, such as the documentation\nof methodological details, the demonstration of computer-based tasks, or\nthe showing of video clips for teaching or scientific presentations.\nDatabrary encourages the storage and sharing of video for all of these\npurposes, in a manner consistent with subject permissions and\ninstitutional approvals.\n\n##### Institutions determine when research ethics board or IRB approval is necessary  {-}\n\nDatabrary does not require prior research ethics board or IRB approval\nfor an Authorized Investigator to be granted access to the system or to\nuse Databrary's shared resources for non-research, educational, or\npre-research uses. However, in signing the Databrary Access Agreement,\nall Authorized Investigators promise to secure research ethics approval\nwhenever their use of Databrary requires it under the Institution's\npolicies.\n\nNon-research, educational, or pre-research use cases may not require\nresearch ethics board or IRB review and approval at every institution.\nInstitutions decide which use cases require research ethics board or IRB\nreview and approval.\n\n##### What data are shared  {-}\n\nDatabrary contains images, video, and audio recordings that may be\nidentifiable, data and metadata that are not typically sensitive, and\nde-identified data. Exact birth dates may be stored for use in\ncalculating exact ages, but exact birth dates are only exposed to\nAuthorized Investigators or Affiliates given specific access to data.\nNames, addresses, email addresses, financial information, government ID\nnumbers, detailed geographic location information, and other personally\nidentifiable data elements are **not** stored and shared on Databrary.\n\n##### Securing permission to share  {-}\n\nIn order to contribute and share identifiable data with Databrary,\nAuthorized Investigators must secure permission to store the recordings\non Databrary from research participants and any other people (e.g.,\nresearch staff) who are recorded.\n\nDatabrary has developed a Sharing Release Template that informs people\ndepicted in recordings of the potential risks associated with sharing\nvideo and other data on Databrary. The Sharing Release Template is one\nof the resources that Databrary has made available to researchers. The\nSharing Release Template may be adapted for use at any Institution and\nadded to any research ethics or IRB protocol. However, an Institution\nmay require other release language in order to provide equivalent\nprotections.\n\nWhether de-identified or pseudonymized data may be shared with Databrary\nwithout seeking explicit permission from research participants depends\non the Authorized Investigator's Institution. Some ethics boards or\nIRBs may allow de-identified or pseudonymized data to be shared without\nthe explicit permission of the research participant.\n\n##### Uploading data and assigning sharing permission levels  {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators who upload data to Databrary must assign to\neach file uploaded the level of data sharing granted by research\nparticipants---from none to public access. The sharing level assigned to\neach file by default is *Private*, meaning that no person other than the\nAuthorized Investigator who uploaded the file and any Affiliates granted\naccess by the Authorized Investigator, may view the file.\n\nNot only are data files assigned a *Private* sharing level by default,\nbut all newly created datasets are initially made *Private*, accessible\nonly to an Authorized Investigator, any Affiliates the Authorized\nInvestigator selects, and any other individual Authorized Investigators\ngranted specific access to the dataset. An Authorized Investigator may\nelect to create an overview of a dataset when it is created and make the\noverview publicly available. The overview can serve as the public face\nof the dataset while the dataset is being collected and analyzed. This\ncan be useful in documenting progress on a research grant to sponsors.\nThe dataset overview does not expose data unless the Authorized\nInvestigator chooses to do so.\n\n##### Sharing data  {-}\n\nAt a time when the Authorized Investigator chooses---e.g., when a paper\ngoes to press or a grant period ends---the Authorized Investigator may\nchoose to share the dataset with other Authorized Investigators on\nDatabrary. This makes the data contained in the dataset available to\nother Authorized Investigators and possibly the public, but only in\naccordance with the sharing levels selected by Authorized Investigators\nand always subject to the permission granted by participants. That is,\nindividual data files marked *Private* remain accessible only to people\nthe Authorized Investigator specifically selects. Similarly, access to\ndatasets labeled *Private* remains solely under the control of the\nAuthorized Investigator.\n\n##### Databrary and GDPR  {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators may collect personal data from research\nparticipants who have rights under the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR). GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA).\n\nDatabrary's servers are currently located in the United States, and\ndata stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and re-used by\nAuthorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the\nEEA. There are more than 500 Institutions across the globe that have\nsigned the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of\nAuthorized Investigators who have access to shared research data at\n<https://nyu.databrary.org/search?volume=false&f.party_authorization=4&f.party_is_institution=false>.\n\nIn seeking permission to collect data from research participants\ngoverned by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should\ncommunicate to research participants information about who may have\naccess to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored.\nInstitutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for\nensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that\nsatisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of\nGDPR.\n\nDatabrary does not typically store information that links a person's\nidentity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between\nthe Authorized Investigator, the Institution, and Databrary to store\nthis type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy\nof data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal\ndata that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or\nInstitution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary.\nAlso, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other\nAuthorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all\nAuthorized Investigators who accessed a participant's personal data\nprior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators\nshould communicate to research participants that there are limits to a\nparticipant's right to modify or delete personal data that have already\nbeen shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains\nlanguage for this purpose.\n\nWhen accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators,\nInstitutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility\nfor ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have\ngiven in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR\nprovisions.\n\n##### When Authorized Investigators leave an Institution  {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators are expected to inform Databrary when they\nleave an Institution. Institutions may also inform Databrary.\n\nAccess to non-public data shared with other Authorized Investigators\nwill be suspended when an Authorized Investigator leaves an Institution.\nThe suspension extends to an Authorized Investigators' Affiliates.\nAuthorized Investigators will continue to have password-protected access\nto data they uploaded to Databrary once they leave an Institution. When\na new Institution grants authorization, Authorized Investigators will\nregain access to non-public data shared by other Authorized\nInvestigators.\n\nIf an Authorized Investigator retires, is incapacitated due to illness,\nor dies, the Institution should inform Databrary so that the Authorized\nInvestigator's account may be suspended. An Institution may choose to\ndesignate a data steward for the Authorized Investigator's data and\nauthorize that person to manage access to the data. If the Institution\ndoes not identify and authorize a data steward, Databrary staff will\nserve that role. However, the Databrary staff serving as data steward\nwill not change the data sharing status of any specific dataset without\nexplicit written guidance from the Institution.\n\n##### Selecting Affiliates  {-}\n\nIf permitted by their Institution, an Authorized Investigator may grant\na person outside their Institution Affiliate status. Institutions may\nestablish policies governing the selection and management of Affiliates\nby their Authorized Investigators.\n\nIf a person is eligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home\nInstitution, that person must apply for access to Databrary through\ntheir home Institution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers\neligible to be Authorized Investigators at their home Institution should\nnot be granted access to Databrary as the Affiliate of another\nAuthorized Investigator either from the same Institution or a different\none. Databrary welcomes questions about these policies. Please email\n<contact@databrary.org>.\n\n### For Researchers  {-}\n\nThis section explains how to apply for authorization, select and manage\naffiliates, collect data that can be shared, upload and manage datasets\nand studies, and explore, re-use, and extend the resources shared with\nDatabrary.\n\n##### Getting Authorized  {-}\n\nSome materials on Databrary are available to the public, but access to\nmost data requires that a person secure formal written authorization\nfrom an Institution. The Databrary Access Agreement is the legally\nbinding document that formalizes the authorization process.\n\nIndividuals who are eligible to conduct independent research, submit\nfunding proposals as the lead investigator, have Principal Investigator\n(PI) status, or have tenure-track faculty positions at their\nInstitution, may apply to their Institution for approval to be named an\nAuthorized Investigator. To receive authorization a person must apply\nfor and receive authorization from their Institution; Databrary does not\ngrant authorization separate from an Institution. In the U.S., a college\nor university's grants and contracts or sponsored programs office\nusually takes responsibility for granting authorization by signing the\nDatabrary Access Agreement. Databrary staff will work with a researcher\nand an Institution to secure signatures on the Databrary Access\nAgreement. The authorization process typically takes a few days to a few\nweeks.\n\n##### Selecting and managing Affiliates {-}\n\nOnce authorized by their Institution, Authorized Investigators may then\nauthorize staff, undergraduate or graduate students, or postdoctoral\ntrainees to access Databrary as Affiliates. In granting a person\nAffiliate status, an Authorized Investigator takes responsibility for\nthat person's use of Databrary.\n\nAn Authorized Investigator may grant a person outside their Institution\nAffiliate status if permitted by their Institution. If a person is\neligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home Institution,\nthat person should apply for access to Databrary through their home\nInstitution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers eligible to be\nAuthorized Investigators should not be granted access to Databrary as\nthe Affiliate of another Authorized Investigator.\n\nAuthorized Investigators are responsible for ensuring that Affiliates\nhave human subjects and/or animal research training appropriate for the\nInstitution and remain in good standing with the Institution.\n\n##### Affiliate access to an Authorized Investigator's data  {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators determine which of the Authorized\nInvestigator's datasets an Affiliate has access to. Authorized\nInvestigators can set each Affiliate's access to one of the following\nlevels:\n\n-   *No access*: Affiliate cannot access any of the Authorized\n    Investigator's data. This is the default.\n-   *Read-only access*: Affiliate has view access to all of the\n    Authorized Investigator's data. (The affiliate may view and\n    download videos and other identifying information, including data\n    that is not released for sharing.)\n-   *Read/Write Access*: Affiliate can access and edit all of the\n    Authorized Investigator's data. (The affiliate may view, download, add,\n    change, and remove data as the Authorized Investigator without\n    restriction.)\n-   *Manager*: Affiliate can access and change permissions on all of the\n    Authorized Investigator's data. (The Affiliate may additionally\n    change the access controls and sharing levels of the Authorized\n    Investigator's data. Manager-level permission should be granted\n    with utmost care.)\n\nThese levels are analogous to granting an Affiliate different levels of\naccess to the Authorized Investigator's laboratory data server.\nAccordingly, the Investigator must trust Affiliates granted this access\nand supervise and manage Affiliates granted these privileges. The\nAuthorized Investigator must assign an expiration date to each\nAffiliate's access.\n\n##### Affiliate access to Databrary  {-}\n\nAffiliates can only gain access to data on Databrary that has been\nshared by *other* Authorized Investigators if specifically granted that\naccess by their supervising Authorized Investigator. The Authorized\nInvestigator must assign an expiration date to each Affiliate's access.\n\nMany Authorized Investigators grant Affiliates access only to datasets\nthe Authorized Investigator controls, not to other datasets shared on\nDatabrary. Some Authorized Investigators grant access to datasets shared\non Databrary to senior graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, or\ntrusted research staff.\n\n##### Accessing data shared by others  {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators automatically have access to data on Databrary\nthat has been shared by other Authorized Investigators. Affiliates only\nhave access to shared data on Databrary only if granted that access by\nthe Authorized Investigator who supervises them.\n\n**Release levels**\n\nIn order to make it clear to participants and researchers what level of\naccess should be granted to specific files, Databrary has developed a\nset of standard release levels. These levels are indicated with\nconsistent icons and language across the site. The levels are as\nfollows:\n\n-   *Unknown*. Consent missing or not obtained. This content is not\n    shared and access is restricted to specific people selected by an\n    Authorized Investigator.\n-   *Private*. This content is not shared and access is restricted to\n    specific people selected by an Authorized Investigator. *Note*: This\n    is the default for all files and must be specifically changed by an\n    Authorized Investigator (or an Affiliate with suitable privileges).\n-   *Authorized Users*. This content is restricted to authorized\n    Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted\n    access to shared Databrary data) and may not be redistributed in any\n    form.\n-   *Learning Audiences*. This content is restricted to authorized\n    Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted\n    access to shared Databrary data), who may use clips or images from\n    it in presentations for informational or educational purposes. Note\n    that such presentations may be videotaped or recorded and those\n    videos or recordings may then be made available to the public via\n    the internet (e.g., YouTube).\n-   *Public*. This content is available openly to anyone.\n\nAll Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must follow the restrictions\non uses indicated by these release levels. Furthermore, when using files\nreleased for access by *Learning Audiences* Authorized Investigators and\nAffiliates must exercise professional judgment in deciding what clips or\nimages to show to what audiences and in what contexts.\n\n**Non-research uses**\n\nMany uses of Databrary do not constitute research, for example, browsing\nshared videos, downloading videos of displays or procedures, or showing\nexcerpts in research or educational presentations. Authorized\nInvestigators (and their Affiliates) must follow Institutional policies\nconcerning whether specific non-research uses of Databrary require prior\nInstitutional approval. Moreover, Authorized Investigators and\nAffiliates must always respect the release level associated with shared\nfiles. For example, data marked with an *Authorized Users* release level\nmay only be viewed in research contexts (e.g., in the Authorized\nInvestigator's laboratory) by the Authorized Investigator or people\nunder the supervision of the Authorized Investigator. Similarly, only\nthose data with a release level of *Learning Audiences* or *Public* may\nbe shown in research or educational presentations outside the Authorized\nInvestigator's laboratory.\n\n**Research uses**\n\nAuthorized Investigators must secure Institutional approvals prior to\nconducting research with data shared on Databrary. In the U.S. context,\nconducting secondary analysis on shared video data may not qualify as\nhuman subjects research because there is no direct contact with research\nparticipants. Still, a research project involving video data reuse may\nrequire ethics board or IRB review and approval because the data are\nidentifiable.\n\n**Contributing new data**\n\nOnly Authorized Investigators may create new datasets, and only\nAuthorized Investigators may share datasets with others.\n\n##### Non-sensitive/non-identifiable data or materials {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators may upload to Databrary and share\nnon-identifiable videos of research procedures, computer displays,\nresearch protocols, analysis code, or other research materials without\nany additional approvals, provided that sharing these elements with\nDatabrary does not violate intellectual property rights of any person.\nDe-identified or pseudonymized research data may be uploaded and shared\nsubject to Institutional policies and approval. If an Authorized\nInvestigator already has approval to share a de-identified or\npseudonymized dataset with other researchers or with the public, then\nsharing that dataset on Databrary is permitted. All files uploaded to\nDatabrary must be marked with a sharing release level. The default\nsharing release level is *Private*. While many\nnon-sensitive/de-identified or pseudonymized data files could be made\navailable to the public, it may be prudent to share de-identified or\npseudonymized datasets only with Authorized Investigators.\n\n##### Identifiable or sensitive data {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators must make preparations to share identifiable or\nsensitive data with Databrary. The next section describes some of these\npreparations.\n\n##### Securing Institutional approval {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators must secure approval from their Institutions\nprior to sharing data with Databrary. Institutional approval usually\ninvolves research ethics board or IRB review or its equivalent. Approval\nto share data may be included in a new research protocol application or\nas an amendment to an existing protocol.\n\nFor human subjects data, Databrary recommends adapting the Databrary\nRelease Template although the exact Databrary Release Template language\nis not required. The Databrary Release Template serves as a guideline.\nThe Institutional research ethics board or IRB must determine what\nspecific language should be used for securing data sharing permission\nand whether requesting permission to share data should be part of the\nresearch consent process or separate from it. It is essential that\nwhatever language and permission process the Institution requires\nenables the Authorized Investigator to determine clearly what level of\nsharing release participants have granted. Authorized Investigators must\nbe able to assign a sharing release level to each file uploaded to\nDatabrary that reflects the sharing permission granted by the research\nparticipant.\n\nIn some cases, research ethics boards and IRBs have deemed that certain\nrelease language in research consent forms from previously collected\ndata permits sharing in Databrary. This has made archival data collected\nprior to the creation of Databrary to be stored and shared in the\nlibrary. If an Authorized Investigator has archival data, Databrary\nstaff are happy to discuss whether and how these might be stored and\nshared on the system.\n\n#### Removing data destruction clauses {-}\n\nThere are often misconceptions about regulations pertaining to data\ndestruction, especially where video or audio recordings are concerned.\nIn the U.S., NIH and NSF do not require data destruction. Data\ndestruction clauses inherently conflict with the ability to store and\nshare data indefinitely via repositories like Databrary. Rather than\npromising to destroy data after some time period in a research protocol,\nDatabrary recommends the following language: \"Data will be stored for\nan indefinite period in a restricted data library on the internet\n(databrary.org).\"\n\n#### Obtaining participant release for sharing {-}\n\nOnce research protocol approval has been granted, Authorized\nInvestigators may start securing permission from participants and\nrecording those permissions.\n\nAuthorized Investigators must ensure that the process used for obtaining\nparticipant release for sharing meets relevant regulatory requirements,\ne.g. GDPR.\n\n##### Why ask {-}\n\nVideo and audio recordings of participants are inherently identifiable.\nIn order to share identifiable data on Databrary Authorized\nInvestigators must secure permission from the people depicted in\nrecordings or images. Authorized Investigators can share identifiable\nresearch recordings (or other identifiable data elements like birth\ndates) only when the Authorized Investigators (a) get approval from\ntheir Institutions to do so, (b) inform participants about what sharing\nthese data elements means, and (c) secure participants' permission to\nshare. Databrary calls this data sharing permission a \"release\" since\nit involves releasing data for use by other researchers.\n\n##### When to ask {-}\n\nDatabrary recommends that Authorized Investigators ask participants for\npermission to share at the end of data collection after participants\nhave acquired first-hand knowledge about the study procedures. This\nensures that consent to participate is completely separate from\npermission to share and the risk that asking participants about sharing\ntheir data will affect their decision about whether or not to\nparticipate in research. However, some Institutions may prefer to have\nAuthorized Investigators incorporate data sharing permission into the\nresearch consent process or even to have data sharing permission be part\nof an entirely separate protocol. The important and essential point is\nto secure sharing permission and record it faithfully.\n\n##### How to ask {-}\n\nTo standardize the process of obtaining data sharing releases from\nparticipants---and make it as simple as possible for\nresearchers---Databrary has developed the Databrary Release Template.\nThe template can be added to or incorporated within human subjects\nresearch ethics protocols. The Databrary Release Template was developed\nand refined in close consultation with the IRB office at NYU. It gives\nresearchers a standardized way to obtain the necessary permissions to\nshare data in Databrary.\nThe template makes it clear and unambiguous to participants about what\nagreeing to share data in Databrary will mean.\n\n### Uploading to Databrary {-}\n\n#### What to upload {-}\n\nIn addition to video, Databrary can store many types of data and\nsupplemental files associated with a research project. These can be\nimages, graphs, stimuli, protocols, blank questionnaires, analysis code,\nand consent or release documents. Databrary permits Authorized\nInvestigators to store any information permitted by the Institution.\nHowever, some information poses greater risks to participants than\nothers, and these should be stored on Databrary only after special\nconsideration. For example, first or last names, home location\ninformation more specific than state, and contact information are\ngenerally considered high risk for the disclosure of participants'\nidentities. These data items should **not** be uploaded to Databrary.\n\nVideo and audio recordings may be uploaded to Databrary if the\nAuthorized Investigator has secured participant (or parent) permission\nand the Institution approves. Under some circumstances, an Institution\nmay determine that participant (or parent) permission is not necessary\nto store video and audio recordings on Databrary. For example, regarding\nrecordings collected a long time in the past, participant (or parent)\npermission may be unavailable, and the Institution may determine that\nthe risk to participants is low. Or, an Authorized Investigator may\nchoose to store video and audio recordings on Databrary for sharing only\namong collaborators and Affiliates specifically chosen by the Authorized\nInvestigator, but have no plans to share the videos with the broader\nDatabrary community. This use of Databrary is permitted, but\ndiscouraged, as the purpose of Databrary is to foster data sharing\nbeyond an individual research project or group.\n\nExact birth dates or test dates may also be considered identifiable data\nelements. However, these dates can be highly valuable for future\nresearch uses, and may pose a lower level of risk to participants than\nsome other data elements. Accordingly, Databrary permits the storage of\nexact dates, but treats exact dates with special care. The system only\nexposes exact dates to Authorized Investigators or their Affiliates who\nupload the data, and only exposes exact dates in shared datasets if the\nparticipant has agreed to share data (grant sharing release at the\n*Authorized User* level or above).\n\nOther low risk data items like race, ethnicity, gender, and related\npersonal characteristics may be stored on Databrary without specific\npermission.\n\n#### Assignment of sharing release level {-}\n\nThe only essential item of information required for uploading files to\nDatabrary is the sharing release level. Authorized Investigators are\nresponsible for recording participant sharing release permissions and\nassigning them to files uploaded to Databrary. Databrary assigns all\nfiles a default release level of *Private*, so an Authorized\nInvestigator must change the default *Private* release setting in order\nto share a file with people other than an Authorized Investigator's\nAffiliates or Authorized Investigators who are research collaborators on\na specific dataset.\n\n#### Who may upload {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators may upload data, and Authorized Investigators\ndetermine who among their Affiliates may also upload data to Databrary.\n\n#### When to upload {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators need not wait until a research project ends to\nupload data to Databrary. Authorized Investigators may upload files to\nDatabrary as soon as possible after a data collection. This is called\nactive curation. It distributes the time required to curate a dataset\nfor sharing and thereby reduces the overall burden of data sharing.\n\n### Non-human animal data {-}\n\nWe are developing guidance for the use of Databrary to store non-human\nanimal data.\n\n### Sharing data {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators determine when data stored on Databrary are\nready to be shared with the broader community of Databrary Authorized\nInvestigators. Typical 'triggers' for sharing a data collection are\nwhen a paper goes out for review or goes to press, when a grant report\nis prepared, or when a grant period ends. To share a dataset, the\nAuthorized Investigator simply changes the access level on that dataset.\nThis makes metadata about all data and materials visible so that other\nAuthorized Investigators can access them, subject to the sharing release\nlevels indicated for each file. Datasets receive a persistent identifier\n(DOI) when shared. Authorized Investigators may \"unshare\" a dataset,\nbut except under unusual circumstances, this is not considered best\npractice.\n\n### Removing or altering participant data {-}\n\nResearch participants in the European Economic Area (EEA) have certain\nrights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) pertaining to\nthe use, sharing, and removal of their personal data.\n\nSince Databrary does not typically store information that maps personal\nidentities to the data stored on Databrary without a separate agreement,\nAuthorized Investigators and Institutions are responsible for responding\nto any requests to provide copies of, change, restrict access to, or\ndelete a participants' personal data stored on Databrary. Databrary\ncannot guarantee that personal data previously shared on Databrary can\nbe retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who have accessed the\ndata. Thus, in seeking permission from research participants to share\npersonal data via Databrary, Authorized Investigators should communicate\nthat there are limits to a participant's right to modify or delete\npersonal data previously shared on Databrary.\n\n### Changing institutions {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators who change Institutions must notify Databrary\nof the change and its effective date. As soon as possible, the\nAuthorized Investigator must secure authorization from their new\nInstitution. Authorized Investigators who are awaiting authorization\nfrom their new Institution will have access to their own data but not to\nnon-public data shared by other Authorized Investigators on Databrary.\nOnce an Authorized Investigator has secured approval from the new\nInstitution, full access privileges will be restored.\n\nDefinitions\n===========\n\n**Access Agreement**: The Databrary Access Agreement between an\nAuthorized Investigator and his or her Institution and New York\nUniversity (NYU) on behalf of Databrary.\n\n**Affiliate**: A person who conducts research under an Authorized\nInvestigator's sponsorship and supervision and who has been granted\naccess to Databrary by the Authorized Investigator. In most cases,\nAffiliates are students or research staff and are not eligible for\nAuthorized Investigator status.\n\n**Authorized Investigator**: A person who has permission from an\nInstitution to conduct independent research and who has received\nauthorization from an Institution and from Databrary to access\nDatabrary.\n\n**Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR)**: A person granted\nauthority by an Institution to sign the Databrary Access Agreement on\nbehalf of the Institution and thereby bind the Institution to the terms\nof the Databary Access Agreement.\n\n**Institution**: An academic, not-for-profit, research, government, or\nhealth entity whose employees or students conduct scientific research or\neducational activities.\n\n**Session**: A type of folder in Databrary \n\n**Materials**: A type of folder in Datatbrary for items such as stimuli, blank survey materials.\n\n<!-- **Participant Sharing Levels**:
