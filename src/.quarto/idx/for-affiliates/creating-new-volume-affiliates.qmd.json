We encourage corresponding actions to be performed before the project is in collecting data process. In this case, you would utilize the upload as you go method of data curation. \n\nWe have intentionally limited the permissions to manage the volume to ensure data security. Creating volumes is a privilege granted to the project's **Manager** status affiliates, and sharing the volume is **not** allowed for affiliates.\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n**Volumes cannot be deleted once created.** \n:::\n\nIf you have created a volume by mistake, you can hide the volume by restricting access to others or rename the volume so that it can be reused by another future project. \n\n\n## Step 1: Login/Go to Profile {- #step1}\nLet's get started with creating a new volume.\n\nReview [Onborading-affiliates](onboarding-affiliates.qmd) for how to find your profile.\n\n![Volumes you own or shared by others](img/db-dashboard-shared-volume.png){#dashboard-volumes}\n\n## Step 2: Look for Create a new volume button {- #step2}\n\nIf the button is not available, check your sponsor status by reviewing your profile.\nIf you are not granted with **Manager** status, you will not be able to create a new volume.\n\n![Affiliates with Read-only Access](img/db-profile-sponsor.png){#profile-sponsor}\n\nRead-Only access will not allow you to create a new volume. Only affiliates granted with **Manager** status will be able to create a new volume. Meanwhile, affiliates at all circumstances may not share access to the volume with others even with the manager status.\n\n![Affiliates with the manager status.](img/db-profile-sponsor-manager.png){#profile-sponsor-manager}\n\nIf you have been granted with access to create a new volume, you will see the button `Create a new volume` under **Your Sponsor Volumes**. \n\n![Create a new volume](img/db-dashboard-create-volume.png){#dashboard-create-volume}\n\n## Step 3: Click Create a new volume button to create a new volume {- #step3}\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nAgain, creating a new volume with careful consideration is important. Once created, the volume **cannot** be deleted.\n:::\n\nClick the button `Create a new volume` to create a new volume. \n\n\nClick on `Create Volume` to the right of **Data Owner Volumes**\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-create-volume.JPG\")\n```\n\nThere are multiple tabs on the left side of the screen that need to be completed to set up a new volume. In this page, you will be asked to provide the following information: **overview, manage access, design spreadsheet, enter data, add links, ** and **list fundings**.  These tabs need to be completed in order.\n\n## Step 4: Enter Dataset Overview {- #step4}\n\nVolume **Overview** is created by choosing if the volume is related to a published resource and answering the related questions (Title, Description, Internal Short Name and additional citation information if necessary). \n\nPlease describe the context of data collection and the types of data that will be uploaded (e.g. video, pictures, coding files, survey data, etc.). The recommended template is provided. Please be sure to fill in all of the brackets with the relevant information for your volume.\n\n   This dataset focuses on [**Provide provide a description of behavor, location of study, and age range**].  Dataset includes [**Enter description of videos, questionnaires, materials, etc.**]\n   \n   Videos were [**Provide provide a general description of what the videos were coded for. (Some examples may include: transcribed for mother speech and child vocalizations; coded for mother and child object interaction; child locomotion and emotion).**] (see Materials folder).\n   \n   This volume contains [**Enter list the types of files along with approximate numbers for each. Some examples are provided below**]: \n   \n   - XX videos (MP4/MOV files) \n   - XX Datavyu transcription files (OPF files)\n   - XX Datavyu coding files (OPF files) \n   - Questionnaire data (.xls file) \n   - Several video exemplars of child behaviors (.mp4 files) \n   - Transcription manual (.docx file) \n   - Coding manual (.docx file) \n   - Scripts for processing and exporting data from Datayu (Ruby)\n   - Materials folder containing stimuli, copies of questionnaires used in study, additional participant demographic information, and other materials utilized for the study. \n   - Exemplar study intake video of experimenter with participant \n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-example-data-description.png\")\n```\n\nIf you need this data to be associated with a DOI, please answer `YES` to the question **Does this volume correspond to a published paper or resource**\n\nWhen all items are entered, select `Save`\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-new-volume-overview.png\")\n```\n\nYou may have the option to enter Keywords associated with the Volume. See [below](#Volume) for description.\n\n## Step 5: Manage Access {- #step5}\n\nNext, go to **Manage Access** to choose volume sharing options and add collaborators (faculty, staff, students) that already have an account on Databrary that is Sponsored by an Institution or an Authorized Investigator.\n\nClick `Save` when done.\n\nPlease be sure to pick the appropriate sharing setting, Private, Share Volume Overview Only or Share Entire Volume. The default sharing setting is Private.\n\nPrivate: keeps the volume private to you and your chosen affiliates and collaborators\n\nShare Volume Overview Only: This will only share the Title and description of the volume exactly as it is entered in the Overview Tab\n\nShared: \n\nPlease note: Only the Authorized Investigator who created this volume can 'Share Entire Volume'\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-new-volume-manage-access.JPG\")\n```\n\n## Step 6: Design Spreadsheet {- #step6}\n\nNow, go to **Design Spreadsheet** and choose all the categories and sub-categories you would like to include in your spreadsheet for participant/session metadata.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-new-volume-design-spreadsheet.png\")\n```\n\n### Definitions for all Spreadsheet Options\n\n**participant: An individual human subject whose data are used or represented**\n\n`ID` A unique, anonymized, primary identifier, such as a participant ID.\n\n`info` Other information or alternative identifier\n\n`birthdate` Date of birth (used with session date to calculate age)\n\n`description` A longer explanation or description *('description' is NOT sortable through the Databrary volume filters)*\n\n`gender` \"Male\", \"Female\", or any other relevent gender\n\n`race` As classified by NIH, or user-defined classification\n\n`ethnicity` As classified by NIH (Hispanic/Non-Hispanic), or user-defined classification\n\n`gestational age` Pregnancy age in weeks between last menstrual period and birth (or pre-natal observation)\n\n`pregnancy term` \"Full term\", \"Preterm\", or other gestational term (assumed \"Full term\" by default)\n\n`birth weight` Weight at birth (in grams, e.g., 3250)\n\n`disability` Any developmental, physical, or mental disability or disabilities (assumed \"Typical\" by default)\n\n`language` Primary language(s) spoken by and to participant (assumed \"English\" by default)\n\n`country` Country where participant was born (assumed \"US\" by default)\n\n`state` State/territory where particpiant was born\n\n`setting` The physical context of the participant (please do not use for new data: see the context category instead)\n\n**pilot: Indicates that the methods used were not finalized or were non-standard**\n\n`name` A label or identifier referring to the pilot method *(This is the only field in the \"pilot\" section that is sortable through the Databrary volume filters)*\n\n`description` A longer explanation or description of the pilot method\n\n**exclusion: Indicates that deta were not usable**\n\n`name` A label or identifier referring to the exclusion criterion *(This is the only field in the \"exclusion\" section that is sortable through the Databrary volume filters)*\n\n`reason` The reason for excluding these data\n\n`description` A longer explanation or description of the reason for excluding data\n\n**condition: An experimenter-determined manipulation (within or between sessions)**\n\n`name` A label or identifier referring to the exclusion criterion *(This is the only field in the \"label\" section that is sortable through the Databrary volume filters)*\n\n`reason` The reason for excluding these data\n\n`description` A longer explanation or description of the reason for excluding data\n\n**group: A grouping determined by an aspect of the data (participant ability, age, grade level, experience, longitudinal visit, measurements used/available)**\n\n`name` A label or identifier referring to the exclusion criterion *(This is the only field in the \"group\" section that is sortable through the Databrary volume filters)*\n\n`reason` The reason for excluding these data\n\n`description` A longer explanation or description of the reason for excluding data\n\n**task: A particular task, activity, or phase of the session or study**\n\n`name` A label or identifier referring to the exclusion criterion *(This is the only field in the \"task\" section that is sortable through the Databrary volume filters)*\n\n`reason` The reason for excluding these data\n\n`description` A longer explanation or description of the reason for excluding data\n\n**context: A particular setting or other aspect of where/when/how data were collected**\n\n`name` A label or identifier referring to the exclusion criterion\n\n`setting` The physical context\n\n`language` Language used in this context (assumed \"English\" by default)\n\n`country` Country of data collection (assumed \"US\" by default)\n\n`state` State/territory of data collection\n\n## Step 7: Enter Data {- #step7}\n\nNow it is time to **Enter Data**.

Then `Choose File` to navigate to the appropriate file. Finally click `Upload`.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-enter-data-participant.png\")\n```\n\nYou will see a window that summarizes the data uploaded and will point out any potential errors (e.g. wrong header names, missing data)\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-data-upload-summary.png\")\n```\n\nPlease review these data\n\nThen click `Yes`.\n\nNow the uploaded data will show like this.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-uploaded-metadata.png\")\n```\n\nAfter the participant metadata is uploaded, the data regarding the testing session and any relevant filed get uploaded individually. \n\nSee video instructions or follow the step by step instructions below.\n\n```{r,  fig.align=\"center\"}\nknitr::include_url(\"https://nyu.databrary.org/slot/27588/0,170067/asset/122480/download?inline=true\")\n```\n\nClick on the `folder` tab.\n\nClick on `add folder` and choose to add a **session** or **materials** folder.\n\n```{r, out.width=\"100%\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-add-folder.png\")\n```\n\nSession folders are for participant sessions and materials folders are for thing related to the study such as surveys used, sample consent forms, and stimuli.\n\nSession folders need to be added individually. Once the Participant ID is entered, the related metadata will be filled in. Then the rest of the session information will need to be added individually.\n\n### Enter Data Individually (the upload as you go method) {- #individually}\n\n- Click inside the **ID** box to add a participant. \n- Complete each metadata item selected to create the participant, then\n- Add files related to that participant\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-new-volume-enter-data.JPG\")\n```\n\n## Step 8: Add Links {- #step8}\n\nPlease share more information in your Databrary Volume using **Add Links**. Here you will want to add links to any outside resources related to this dataset (e.g. published paper, github repository)\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-new-volume-add-links.JPG\")\n```\n\n## Step 9: List Funding {- #step9}\n\nFinally, please share your funding source for your volume in **List Funding**. If your funding source is not listed here, please email Databrary Staff at contact@databrary.org to have it added.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../include/img/db-new-volume-list-funding.JPG\")\n```\n\n\n## Related Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) {.unnumbered}\n\n<div class = \"\"qa>\n\n::: question\nQ: I don't know how to get authorized as a manager. \n:::\n\n::: answer\nA: Manager status is authorized by their sponsor during the  [requesting-access-affiliates](requesting-access-affiliates.qmd) where the sponsor will be asked to choose the status of an affiliate. \n\n![Grant access by sponsors](img/db-grant-access.png){#grant-access}\n\nMake sure you have the right status.
