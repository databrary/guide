{"title":"For institutions","markdown":{"headingText":"For institutions","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nInstitutions play a central role in the Databrary ecosystem.\nThis section describes some of those roles and responsibilities.\nIt is designed to answer the questions an official with grants and contracts or research ethics compliance responsibilities might ask.\n\nMuch of the material is adapted from the [Databrary Access Agreement and its three Annexes](../appendices/access_agreement.qmd).\n\nNote, there are several questions on the [FAQ](../more-information/faq.qmd) page that directly relate to institutional responsibilities, including:\n\n[I qualify as an Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR). Can I sign as both Authorized Investigator and AOR?](../more-information/faq.qmd#i-qualify-as-an-authorized-organizational-representative-aor.-can-i-sign-as-both-authorized-investigator-and-aor)\n\n[How much does Databrary cost?](../more-information/faq.qmd#how-much-does-databrary-cost)\n\nIf you are a researcher, research staff or trainee, you may skip this part.\nOr, you may find it helpful to learn more about the differences between your institution's responsibilities and yours.\n\n## What is Databrary? {-}\n\nDatabrary is a restricted access data library specialized for storing, streaming, and sharing of video and audio recordings. \nDatabrary's mission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and related data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral, educational, and neural sciences.\n\nThe responsibility for protecting research data and research participants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates, Institutions, and Databrary.\n\nDatabrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video\nand related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is\nrestricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by\ntheir Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of\nAuthorized Investigators through a research ethics board or\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that\nrequired to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S.\nGovernment (see:\n<https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html>).\nAuthorized Investigators who share data with others must secure\npermission to share from research participants and record that\npermission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized\nInvestigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other\nAuthorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles,\nincluding respect for the sharing permissions granted by research\nparticipants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights\nof research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data.\n\n## The Databrary Access Agreement permits data use and data contribution  {-}\n\nDatabrary restricts access to Authorized Investigators whose\nInstitutions sign a formal Databrary Access Agreement.\n\nThe Databrary Access Agreement combines provisions for data use and data\ncontribution. Unlike data use agreements that allow specific individuals\naccess to a particular dataset for a discrete research purpose, the\nDatabrary Access Agreement allows any Authorized Investigator to access\nall shared datasets on Databrary and use the datasets for many different\nInstitutionally-approved purposes. In addition, the Databrary Access\nAgreement permits Authorized Investigators to upload data and to share\nit with other Authorized Investigators in accord with the sharing\npermissions granted by participants and any required Institutional\napprovals. Databrary believes that combining data use and data\ncontribution in a single agreement reduces barriers to data sharing,\nmeets emerging funder mandates to share research data, and accelerates\nprogress in research.\n\n## Video's use cases extend beyond research  {-}\n\nIn addition to its many uses in research, video may be used for a\nvariety of pre-research and non-research uses, such as the documentation\nof methodological details, the demonstration of computer-based tasks, or\nthe showing of video clips for teaching or scientific presentations.\nDatabrary encourages the storage and sharing of video for all of these\npurposes, in a manner consistent with subject permissions and\ninstitutional approvals.\n\n## Institutions determine when research ethics board or IRB approval is necessary  {-}\n\nDatabrary does not require prior research ethics board or IRB approval\nfor an Authorized Investigator to be granted access to the system or to\nuse Databrary's shared resources for non-research, educational, or\npre-research uses. However, in signing the Databrary Access Agreement,\nall Authorized Investigators promise to secure research ethics approval\nwhenever their use of Databrary requires it under the Institution's\npolicies.\n\nNon-research, educational, or pre-research use cases may not require\nresearch ethics board or IRB review and approval at every institution.\nInstitutions decide which use cases require research ethics board or IRB\nreview and approval.\n\n## What data are shared  {-}\n\nDatabrary contains images, video, and audio recordings that may be\nidentifiable, data and metadata that are not typically sensitive, and\nde-identified data. Exact birth dates may be stored for use in\ncalculating exact ages, but exact birth dates are only exposed to\nAuthorized Investigators or Affiliates given specific access to data.\nNames, addresses, email addresses, financial information, government ID\nnumbers, detailed geographic location information, and other personally\nidentifiable data elements are **not** stored and shared on Databrary.\n\n## Securing permission to share  {-}\n\nIn order to contribute and share identifiable data with Databrary,\nAuthorized Investigators must secure permission to store the recordings\non Databrary from research participants and any other people (e.g.,\nresearch staff) who are recorded.\n\nDatabrary has developed a Sharing Release Template that informs people\ndepicted in recordings of the potential risks associated with sharing\nvideo and other data on Databrary. The Sharing Release Template is one\nof the resources that Databrary has made available to researchers. The\nSharing Release Template may be adapted for use at any Institution and\nadded to any research ethics or IRB protocol. However, an Institution\nmay require other release language in order to provide equivalent\nprotections.\n\nWhether de-identified or pseudonymized data may be shared with Databrary\nwithout seeking explicit permission from research participants depends\non the Authorized Investigator's Institution. Some ethics boards or\nIRBs may allow de-identified or pseudonymized data to be shared without\nthe explicit permission of the research participant.\n\n## Uploading data and assigning sharing permission levels  {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators who upload data to Databrary must assign to\neach file uploaded the level of data sharing granted by research\nparticipants---from none to public access. The sharing level assigned to\neach file by default is *Private*, meaning that no person other than the\nAuthorized Investigator who uploaded the file and any Affiliates granted\naccess by the Authorized Investigator, may view the file.\n\nNot only are data files assigned a *Private* sharing level by default,\nbut all newly created datasets are initially made *Private*, accessible\nonly to an Authorized Investigator, any Affiliates the Authorized\nInvestigator selects, and any other individual Authorized Investigators\ngranted specific access to the dataset. An Authorized Investigator may\nelect to create an overview of a dataset when it is created and make the\noverview publicly available. The overview can serve as the public face\nof the dataset while the dataset is being collected and analyzed. This\ncan be useful in documenting progress on a research grant to sponsors.\nThe dataset overview does not expose data unless the Authorized\nInvestigator chooses to do so.\n\n## Sharing data  {-}\n\nAt a time when the Authorized Investigator chooses---e.g., when a paper\ngoes to press or a grant period ends---the Authorized Investigator may\nchoose to share the dataset with other Authorized Investigators on\nDatabrary. This makes the data contained in the dataset available to\nother Authorized Investigators and possibly the public, but only in\naccordance with the sharing levels selected by Authorized Investigators\nand always subject to the permission granted by participants. That is,\nindividual data files marked *Private* remain accessible only to people\nthe Authorized Investigator specifically selects. Similarly, access to\ndatasets labeled *Private* remains solely under the control of the\nAuthorized Investigator.\n\n## Databrary and GDPR  {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators may collect personal data from research\nparticipants who have rights under the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR). GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA).\n\nDatabrary's servers are currently located in the United States, and\ndata stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and re-used by\nAuthorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the\nEEA. There are more than 500 Institutions across the globe that have\nsigned the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of\nAuthorized Investigators who have access to shared research data at\n<https://nyu.databrary.org/search?volume=false&f.party_authorization=4&f.party_is_institution=false>.\n\nIn seeking permission to collect data from research participants\ngoverned by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should\ncommunicate to research participants information about who may have\naccess to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored.\nInstitutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for\nensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that\nsatisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of\nGDPR.\n\nDatabrary does not typically store information that links a person's\nidentity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between\nthe Authorized Investigator, the Institution, and Databrary to store\nthis type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy\nof data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal\ndata that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or\nInstitution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary.\nAlso, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other\nAuthorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all\nAuthorized Investigators who accessed a participant's personal data\nprior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators\nshould communicate to research participants that there are limits to a\nparticipant's right to modify or delete personal data that have already\nbeen shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains\nlanguage for this purpose.\n\nWhen accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators,\nInstitutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility\nfor ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have\ngiven in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR\nprovisions.\n\n## When Authorized Investigators leave an Institution  {-}\n\nAuthorized Investigators are expected to inform Databrary when they\nleave an Institution. Institutions may also inform Databrary.\n\nAccess to non-public data shared with other Authorized Investigators\nwill be suspended when an Authorized Investigator leaves an Institution.\nThe suspension extends to an Authorized Investigators' Affiliates.\nAuthorized Investigators will continue to have password-protected access\nto data they uploaded to Databrary once they leave an Institution. When\na new Institution grants authorization, Authorized Investigators will\nregain access to non-public data shared by other Authorized\nInvestigators.\n\nIf an Authorized Investigator retires, is incapacitated due to illness,\nor dies, the Institution should inform Databrary so that the Authorized\nInvestigator's account may be suspended. An Institution may choose to\ndesignate a data steward for the Authorized Investigator's data and\nauthorize that person to manage access to the data. If the Institution\ndoes not identify and authorize a data steward, Databrary staff will\nserve that role. However, the Databrary staff serving as data steward\nwill not change the data sharing status of any specific dataset without\nexplicit written guidance from the Institution.\n\n## Selecting Affiliates  {-}\n\nIf permitted by their Institution, an Authorized Investigator may grant\na person outside their Institution Affiliate status. Institutions may\nestablish policies governing the selection and management of Affiliates\nby their Authorized Investigators.\n\nIf a person is eligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home\nInstitution, that person must apply for access to Databrary through\ntheir home Institution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers\neligible to be Authorized Investigators at their home Institution should\nnot be granted access to Databrary as the Affiliate of another\nAuthorized Investigator either from the same Institution or a different\none. Databrary welcomes questions about these policies.
