# About {.unnumbered}

Databrary is a restricted access and open sharing data repository for behavioral researchers. Databrary specializes in storing, streaming, and sharing video and audio recordings and supports the many other types of research data and documentation like, images and metadata. 

Based at New York University, Databrary's mission is to support data sharing among researchers in the behavioral, social, educational, developmental, neural and computer sciences.

Databrary aims to promote transparency, reproducability, and collaboration. 

We encourage you to read Databrary's Access Agreement and its three annexes. These documents, especially Annex 111-Databrary Access Guide, provide extensive information about how Databrary is structured and how it should be used. You may also get guidance about working with a research ethics board or IRB to see how to incorporate data sharing using Databrary in a Data Management Plan for a grant proposal.
