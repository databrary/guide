# Best Practices

 - Best practices for sharing entire volume when preparing for publication of paper?  Based on information from Databrary volumes in KEA's lab
 - when do I need a new volume or the same volume
 - when do I use materials folder
## How I do describe data?
 - ensure DATA description is complete
  - EG. what file types are included
  - do not just paste abstract
  - avoid acronyms or lab conventions
 - describe displays and task agnostic to research question
   - bad - complimentary gesture study
   - good - videos of child and parent playing with 3 toys from 3 camera angles
