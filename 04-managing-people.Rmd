# Managing people

Authorized investigators can manage their collaborators and affiliates.

## Collaborators {-}

## Affiliates {-}

An Affiliate is a individual who 
- conducts research under an Authorized Investigator's sponsorship and supervision 
- who has been granted access to Databrary by the Authorized Investigator
- is a student, research staff, or Post-doctoral research
- is not eligible for Authorized Investigator status.

The Supervisor or Research Sponsor must register as an Authorized Investigator BEFORE you may request affiliate access from them.

An affiliate will not have access to non-public data on Databrary until AFTER the Authorized Investigator has submitted all paperwork to Databrary, and granted the affiliate appropriate access.
