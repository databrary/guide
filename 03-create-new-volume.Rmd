</p>

There are multiple tabs on the left side of the screen that need to be completed to set up a new volume. These tabs need to be completed in order.

## Step 3: Enter Dataset Overview {- #step3}

Volume **Overview** is created by choosing if the volume is related to a published resource and answering the related questions (Title, Description, Internal Short Name and additional citation information if necessary). 

Please describe the context of data collection and the types of data uploaded (e.g. video, pictures, )

If you need this data to be associated with a DOI, please answer `YES` to the question **Does this volume correspond to a published paper or resource**

When all items are entered, select `Save`

## Step 4: Manage Access {- #step4}

Next, go to **Manage Access** to choose volume sharing options and add collaborators (faculty, staff, students) that already have an account on Databrary that is Sponsored by an Institution or an Authorized Investigator.

Click `Save` when done.

Please be sure to pick the appropriate sharing setting, Private, Share Volume Overview Only or Share Entire Volume. The default sharing setting is Private.

Please note: Only the Authorized Investigator who created this volume can 'Share Entire Volume'

</p>

## Step 6: Enter Data {- #step6}

Now it is time to **Enter Data**. There are two options:

### Upload a participant metadata file. {- #participantmetadata}

See video instructions to [upload participant metadata](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/686/slot/27587/-?asset=122478) or follow the instructions below.

What is an appropriately formatted .csv file?

- ensure that the Header row is exactly the same as the **Spreadsheet Preview** in the `Design Spreadsheet` tab.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/db-design-spreadsheet.png" alt="Participant Tab" width="70%"/>
</p>

so this .csv file would look like:

<p align="center">
<img src="img/db-participant-metadata.png" alt="Participant Tab" width="70%"/>
</p>

Now it is time to upload the participant .csv file. 

Click the `participant` tab. Then `Choose File` to navigate to the appropriate file. Finally click `Upload`.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/db-enter-data-participant.png" alt="Participant Tab" width="70%"/>
</p>

You will see a window that summarizes the data uploaded and will point out any potential errors (e.g. wrong header names, missing data)

<p align="center">
<img src="img/db-data-upload-summary.png" alt="Participant Tab" width="70%"/>
</p>

Please review these data

Then click `Yes`.

Now the uploaded data will show like this.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/db-uploaded-metadata.png" alt="Participant Tab" width="70%"/>
</p>


After the participant metadata is uploaded, the data regarding the testing session and any relevant filed get uploaded individually. See video instructions for uploading [participant session data](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/686/slot/27588/-?asset=122480) or follow the instructions below.

Click on the  `folder` tab

Click on `add folder` and choose to add a **session** or **materials** folder.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/db-add-folder.png" alt="Participant Tab" width="70%"/>
</p>

Session folders are for participant sessions and materials folders are for thing related to the study such as surveys used, sample consent forms, and stimuli.
